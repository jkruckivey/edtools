## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
## What Did You Learn?

You've explored ethical sponsorship through the LIV Golf case, analyzed sportswashing dynamics, mapped stakeholder impacts, and experienced Phil Mickelson's $200M decision from the inside.

Now capture what you learned. This isn't about getting the "right answer"—it's about showing you can navigate ethical complexity in sponsorship decisions.
```

## Element 2: Infobox - Assessment Overview

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element
2. Choose variant: **Assessment** (purple)
3. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
Title: ▪ Assessment: Ethical Sponsorship Reflection (25 points)

**Your Task:** In 300 words or less, reflect on what you learned about ethical considerations in sponsorship decisions.

**Your reflection should address:**

1. **The Core Tension** - What makes sponsorship decisions ethically complex? Use LIV Golf as your example.
2. **Stakeholder Trade-offs** - How do different stakeholders (customers, employees, shareholders) view controversial sponsorships differently?
3. **Your Framework** - Based on the Mickelson roleplay and case analysis, what's YOUR threshold for when ethical concerns should outweigh financial opportunity?

**Grading (25 points):**
- Ethical complexity understanding (10 pts)
- Stakeholder trade-off analysis (8 pts)
- Personal framework articulation (7 pts)

**Tip:** Be specific. "Ethics matter" is vague. "Premium brands face higher reputational risk because 38% of consumers avoid sportswashing-associated brands, while challenger brands have less to lose" shows framework thinking.
```

## Element 3: Text Response - Ethical Sponsorship Reflection

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise → Text Response Question**
2. Configure the following fields:

**Question:**
```
What did you learn about ethical considerations in sponsorship decisions? Reflect in 300 words or less.
```

**Additional Instructions:**
```
Your response will be evaluated on:

**Ethical Complexity Understanding (10 pts)**
- Explains what makes sponsorship decisions ethically complex (not just "some sponsors are bad")
- Uses LIV Golf as a specific example
- Demonstrates understanding of sportswashing as a concept

**Stakeholder Trade-off Analysis (8 pts)**
- Shows how different stakeholders view controversial sponsorships differently
- References specific stakeholder groups (customers, employees, shareholders, media)
- Acknowledges that reasonable people can disagree

**Personal Framework Articulation (7 pts)**
- States a clear position on when ethics should outweigh financial opportunity
- References the Mickelson roleplay experience
- Shows strategic reasoning, not just opinion

**Reference the Module 5 content:**
- The sportswashing framework
- The LIV Golf sponsor portfolio (who signed vs. declined)
- Your Phil Mickelson roleplay decision
```

**AI Feedback Prompt:**
```
Evaluate this ethical sponsorship reflection. Check for:
1. Did they explain WHY sponsorship decisions are ethically complex (not just that they are)?
2. Did they reference specific stakeholder perspectives from the case?
3. Did they articulate a personal threshold or framework (not just "it depends")?

Provide brief, encouraging feedback. If their analysis is vague, ask for specific examples from the LIV Golf case.
```

**Rubric Configuration:**

---

**CRITERION 1: Ethical Complexity Understanding**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Treats ethical issues as black-and-white ("sportswashing is bad"). No nuance about why decisions are complex. Doesn't reference LIV Golf specifics.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Shows some understanding of ethical complexity but doesn't fully develop it. May mention sportswashing without explaining the debate around its effectiveness.

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Clearly articulates what makes sponsorship decisions ethically complex (e.g., "LIV Golf offers attractive economics but raises concerns about legitimizing human rights abuses"). References the sportswashing debate—acknowledges that evidence is mixed and reasonable people disagree.

---

**CRITERION 2: Stakeholder Trade-off Analysis**

**Points:** 8

**Does not meet expectations (0-2 pts):**
No stakeholder analysis. Treats "the public" as monolithic. Doesn't reference different perspectives.

**Partially meets expectations (3-5 pts):**
Mentions stakeholders but doesn't analyze trade-offs. May list groups without explaining how they view the issue differently.

**Fully meets expectations (6-8 pts):**
Shows how different stakeholders have different risk tolerances: "Employees (52% uncomfortable) create internal pressure; customers (38% would avoid) create market risk; shareholders may prioritize financial returns." Acknowledges tensions between stakeholder interests.

---

**CRITERION 3: Personal Framework Articulation**

**Points:** 7

**Does not meet expectations (0-2 pts):**
No clear personal position. Hedges with "it depends" without specifying on what. No reference to roleplay experience.

**Partially meets expectations (3-4 pts):**
States a position but reasoning is thin. May say "I wouldn't sponsor LIV Golf" without explaining the threshold or framework.

**Fully meets expectations (5-7 pts):**
Clear personal framework with reasoning: "My threshold: if >20% of target customers would boycott AND employees express concern, ethics outweigh economics regardless of ROI." References Mickelson roleplay decision and what it revealed about their own values.

## Instructor Notes

**Module 6 Purpose:**
- Assess Week 3 learning through reflection on LIV Golf case and roleplay experience
- Lighter assessment aligned with simplified Module 5 (case + roleplay, not full analysis)
- Clean handoff to Module 7 (CFL Expansion milestone)

**Assessment Flow (Simplified Modules 5-6):**
1. Module 5: Students read case, use analysis tools, complete Mickelson roleplay (~45-60 min)
2. Module 6: Students write 300-word reflection on what they learned (25 pts)

**Why Lighter Assessment:**
- Module 5 provides substantial learning through case reading and roleplay
- Assessment should match the learning investment
- 300 words is enough to demonstrate ethical reasoning
- Reflection format encourages genuine wrestling with ambiguity over "right answer" hunting

**For Students Who Want More Challenge:**
Students who engaged deeply with the Mickelson roleplay can provide more detailed analysis of the decision dynamics. The rubric rewards specificity—students who can articulate a clear personal threshold with reasoning will score higher.

**Grading Notes:**
- Look for nuanced thinking (stakeholder trade-offs), not binary judgments
- The personal framework criterion is the key differentiator between surface and deep responses
- Accept any reasonable position if well-defended—no "right answer" on sportswashing
- Specific references to case data and roleplay experience beat vague generalizations
