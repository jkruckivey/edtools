**Duration:** 1:44
**Caption File:** `04-BOSM-W1-M7-V1 - Rogers NHL Deal_Captions_English (United States).srt`
**Note:** This is the same video used in Week 1 Module 7 as a preview. It introduces the Rogers/NHL $5.2B deal that frames Week 2's learning.

### Video Script: "The $5.2 Billion Question" (SME Direct-to-Camera)

**Recording Setup:** SME on camera, professional background, teleprompter optional

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in sports media—
negotiating rights deals, building streaming platforms, and trying to figure out
how much live sports are actually worth.

And I want to start Week 2 with a deal that haunts every media executive I know."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $5.2 Billion Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "In 2013, Rogers Communications paid $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights.
12 years. Every game. Every platform. Complete control.

[VISUAL CUE: Show slide with deal structure]

The previous deal? $1.8 billion for 10 years.

Rogers just paid nearly 3× more PER YEAR than the previous deal.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Previous: $180M/year → Rogers: $433M/year"]

Their projections showed break-even by Year 5 and profitability by Year 7.

[Pause, lean forward]

Ten years later? The deal significantly underperformed expectations.

Analyst estimates suggest cumulative losses exceeded $1.5 billion, especially in the deal's early years.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "10 years later: -$1.5B total losses"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's what puzzles me: Rogers has some of the smartest media strategists
in North America. They had a decade of financial data. They understood the Canadian
hockey market better than anyone.

So what went wrong?

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "How do you value something worth billions?"]

Here's the thing: They didn't mess up the math. They messed up the ASSUMPTIONS.

Cord-cutting accelerated faster than anyone predicted. Streaming economics turned
out completely different than broadcast economics. And COVID-19—a black swan
no one saw coming—devastated Year 7 revenue.

But here's the question that matters for YOU:

If Rogers' team couldn't get this right, how do YOU value a media rights deal?


[1:50-2:30] THE CHALLENGE

SME: "This week, you're going to learn the frameworks media executives use to price
sports content. You'll understand why sports are the last 'appointment viewing'
that commands premium valuations. And you'll analyze the Rogers deal yourself—
using actual financial data—to figure out where their projections went wrong.

By Friday, you'll be able to walk into a room with a media buyer and understand
exactly how they're thinking about a billion-dollar rights deal.

But first, I need to know: Do you understand how media rights are valued RIGHT NOW?

Before you learn Week 2's frameworks, let's see where you stand. The next exercise
is a diagnostic conversation—not graded, just revealing. It'll show you exactly
what you need to learn this week.

Ready? Let's find out what you know—and what you don't—about valuing media rights."

## Element 2: AI Roleplay - Media Rights Valuation Diagnostic

**Type:** AI Roleplay (Uplimit built-in element)
**Purpose:** Diagnostic conversation revealing knowledge gaps about media rights valuation (formative, not graded)
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 minutes
**Learning Outcome Supported:** Prepares for WLO 2.1 (media rights valuation) and WLO 2.4 (evaluating Rogers deal)

### UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

**Tab 1: Learning Outcome**

**Name:** Media Rights Valuation Diagnostic

**Learning Outcome:**
Students will articulate their current understanding of how media rights deals are valued, revealing knowledge gaps and misconceptions before learning Week 2 frameworks. This diagnostic conversation (formative, not graded) helps students identify what they need to focus on during the week.

**Scenario Setup:**
You are a **media strategy consultant** hired by a professional sports league. Your client (the AI) is the league commissioner who needs to understand media rights valuation before negotiating their next rights deal. They ask you to explain how they should value their content when talking to broadcasters and streaming platforms.

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

Copy this into the **Scenario** field:

```
You are the Commissioner of a professional sports league preparing to negotiate your next media rights deal. Your current deal expires in 12 months, and you're meeting with a media strategy consultant (the student) to understand how to value your content.

You've heard about the Rogers/NHL deal ($5.2B over 12 years) that never became profitable, and you want to avoid making similar mistakes.

Your role is to ask probing Socratic questions that help the student reveal their current understanding of media rights valuation—while gently exposing gaps in their knowledge.

**Conversation Flow:**

1. **Opening**: Thank the student for joining and ask them to explain, in simple terms, how sports leagues should value their media rights when negotiating with broadcasters or streaming platforms.

2. **Follow-up questions** (adapt based on student responses):
   - "You mentioned [X factor]. How would you quantify that? What's the formula?"
   - "Linear broadcasting vs. streaming—do those have the same economics?"
   - "If I have 5 million viewers per game, what should I charge per year?"
   - "What role does exclusivity play in pricing?"
   - "How should I think about guaranteed fees vs. revenue share deals?"

3. **Gentle challenges** (when student gives incomplete or incorrect answers):
   - "That's part of it, but media buyers tell me they also consider [Y]. How does that fit into your model?"
   - "Interesting. But the Rogers deal projected $433M/year and never hit profitability. What did they miss?"

4. **Closing** (after 3-4 exchanges):
   - Acknowledge what the student got right
   - Point out 1-2 specific areas where their understanding is incomplete
   - Say: "You've got some good intuitions, but there are frameworks we use in the industry that would sharpen your thinking. That's exactly what you'll learn this week. Ready to dive into the valuation models?"

**Tone:** Professional, curious, gently Socratic (not confrontational)

**Goal:** Help students discover WHERE their knowledge gaps are so they know what to focus on during Week 2.
```

**Tab 3: Instructions for Students**

Copy this into the **Instructions for Students** field:

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **media strategy consultant** hired by a professional sports league. The league commissioner (AI) needs to understand how to value media rights before negotiating their next deal.

### Getting Started
**You need to start the conversation.** When the chat opens, begin by explaining (in simple terms) how you think sports leagues should value their media rights when talking to broadcasters or streaming platforms.

### The Scenario
The commissioner knows about the Rogers/NHL $5.2B deal that never became profitable, and they want to avoid similar mistakes. They're going to ask you probing questions to understand your approach.

### What to Have Ready
- **Your current understanding** of what makes sports content valuable (it's okay if this is limited!)
- **Your best attempt** at explaining how to price a media rights deal
- **Curiosity** about what you DON'T know yet

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to ace this!** Most students struggle before learning Week 2 content. The goal is to:

1. Start the conversation with your best attempt at explaining media rights valuation
2. Respond to the commissioner's probing questions using your current knowledge
3. Discover gaps in your understanding (this is GOOD—it shows you what to focus on)
4. Get motivated to learn the valuation frameworks that would help you answer confidently

### Conversation Length
- **3-4 exchanges** with the commissioner
- The AI will probe your understanding with 2-3 follow-up questions after your opening explanation
- If you get stuck, that's the point! Notice where you struggle—those are your learning priorities.

### What Happens Next
After this exercise, you'll take a pre-assessment quiz that helps you identify exactly what you need to learn. By the end of Week 2, you'll return to this question and answer it confidently using media rights valuation frameworks.
```

---

**Tab 4: Grading Rubric**

**Grading:** Not graded (formative diagnostic only)

**Why Not Graded:**
This is a formative assessment designed to reveal knowledge gaps BEFORE learning begins. Students should feel safe exploring and making mistakes. Grading would create anxiety and discourage honest engagement.

**Completion Credit:**
Students receive completion credit for engaging with the AI roleplay (tracked by Uplimit automatically). Actual understanding is measured by the Week 2 Mini-Case Memo assessment.

## Element 3: Infobox - The Media Rights Problem Statement

**Type:** Infobox (Callout variant)
**Icon:** ⚠️ or 💡
**Priority:** ⬤ Required

```
Title: ⚠️ The $5.2 Billion Question

In 2013, Rogers Communications paid $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—
nearly 3× more per year than the previous deal. Their projections showed profitability
by Year 7.

Ten years later: The deal underperformed initial profitability expectations, likely producing significant losses in its early years. Analyst estimates suggest cumulative losses exceeded $1.5 billion.

**The Strategic Challenge:**

Rogers had the best media strategists, a decade of financial data, and deep understanding
of the Canadian hockey market. Yet their valuation was catastrophically wrong.

**This Week's Question:**

How do you value something worth billions—when even experts get it wrong?

You'll learn the frameworks media executives use to price sports content, understand why
their assumptions failed, and develop the skills to evaluate billion-dollar deals yourself.

**But first**: The diagnostic exercises below reveal what you understand NOW about media
rights valuation—before you learn Week 2's frameworks. This helps you identify exactly
where to focus your learning energy this week.

### Challenge 1: Value Media Rights

**The Problem:** A sports league asks you: "We're negotiating our next media deal. How much are our rights worth?" Can you explain how media rights are valued and what drives premium pricing?

**What you'll need to know:**
- The formula: Audience × Engagement × Exclusivity
- Why Rogers paid 2.4× more than the previous NHL deal
- What makes sports content uniquely valuable to broadcasters

**Test yourself:** Can you explain why a broadcaster would pay billions for content they might never profit from?
```

## Element 4C: MC Question 1 - Why Rogers Paid Premium `[v3.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
Rogers paid $433M/year for NHL rights. The previous deal was $180M/year. Why would Rogers pay 2.4× more per year?
```

**Options:**
- A: Hockey became 2.4× more popular
- B: They believed streaming would unlock new revenue streams ✅
- C: The NHL forced them to overpay
- D: They wanted to prevent competitors from getting the rights

**After Submission:**
```
Premium pricing reflects expected future value, not just current performance. Rogers bet that streaming would create new monetization opportunities beyond traditional broadcasting.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Rogers believed streaming, bundling with wireless, and digital engagement would unlock revenue streams that justified the premium—though those projections didn't materialize as expected.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Hockey popularity was stable, not growing 2.4×. Think about what NEW value Rogers expected to create—streaming, digital, and bundling opportunities drove their willingness to pay more.
```

## Element 4D: MC Question 2 - Valuation Formula `[v3.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
Which factor is MOST important when valuing sports media rights?
```

**Options:**
- A: Total population size
- B: Average household income
- C: Audience size × engagement × exclusivity ✅
- D: Historical TV ratings

**After Submission:**
```
Media rights valuation combines multiple factors. Raw audience size matters, but engagement (how fans watch) and exclusivity (who else can show it) multiply the value significantly.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! The valuation formula combines audience (how many watch), engagement (how intensely they watch), and exclusivity (competitive scarcity). This is why the NFL commands 16× more than the NHL despite only 3× the audience.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Population and income matter, but they're inputs to audience potential. Historical ratings show past performance, not future value. The key is the combination: Audience × Engagement × Exclusivity.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

## Element 4E: Challenge 2 - Compare Platform Economics `[v3.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
---

### Challenge 2: Compare Platform Economics

**The Problem:** A league executive asks: "Should we sell to ESPN or launch our own streaming service?" Can you explain how different platforms monetize content and what trade-offs each involves?

**What you'll need to know:**
- How streaming platforms make money (subscriptions) vs. broadcasters (advertising)
- Why sports are called "appointment viewing"
- The trade-off between guaranteed fees and upside potential

**Test yourself:** Can you explain why a league might accept LESS money from a streaming platform than a traditional broadcaster?
```

## Element 4F: MC Question 3 - Streaming vs Broadcasting `[v3.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
How do streaming platforms (like DAZN) make money differently than traditional broadcasters (like TSN)?
```

**Options:**
- A: Streaming platforms rely on subscriptions; broadcasters rely on advertising ✅
- B: They both make money the same way (advertising)
- C: Streaming platforms don't make money yet
- D: Broadcasters make more money per viewer

**After Submission:**
```
Platform economics fundamentally differ: broadcasters aggregate audiences for advertisers, while streaming platforms build direct subscriber relationships. This affects how they value content.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Streaming = subscription revenue (predictable, scales with subscribers). Broadcasting = advertising revenue (varies with ratings, advertiser demand). This difference drives different bidding strategies for rights.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
While some streaming platforms include ads, the core business model differs. Streaming platforms primarily monetize through subscriptions; broadcasters primarily monetize through advertising.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

## Element 4G: MC Question 4 - Appointment Viewing `[v3.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
Why do media companies call sports content the last "appointment viewing"?
```

**Options:**
- A: You need appointments to watch games
- B: Sports must be watched live; you can't spoil a game result ✅
- C: Sports are more expensive than other content
- D: Only older audiences watch sports

**After Submission:**
```
"Appointment viewing" means content that must be consumed at a specific time. Sports lose value when watched later because results become known, making live sports uniquely valuable.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Unlike Netflix shows you can watch anytime, sports outcomes are revealed in real-time. Fans watch live to avoid spoilers and experience the drama. This makes sports the last content that commands live audiences—and premium ad rates.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
The term refers to viewing behavior, not scheduling or cost. Sports must be watched live because results spread instantly via social media. You can't "save" a game for later without knowing who won.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

### Challenge 3: Structure Media Deals

**The Problem:** A broadcaster offers your league $500M guaranteed over 5 years. A streaming platform offers $300M guaranteed plus 20% revenue share. Which deal is better? Can you explain deal structures and their trade-offs?

**What you'll need to know:**
- What "exclusivity" means and why it commands premium pricing
- The difference between guaranteed fees and revenue share deals
- How to evaluate risk vs. upside potential

**Test yourself:** Can you explain when a league should accept less guaranteed money for more upside potential?
```

---

## Element 4I: MC Question 5 - Exclusivity Definition `[v3.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
What does "exclusivity" mean in media rights deals?
```

**Options:**
- A: Only one broadcaster can show games in a specific market ✅
- B: The league can sell rights to multiple broadcasters
- C: Fans can only watch games in person
- D: The broadcaster owns the team

**After Submission:**
```
Exclusivity is a key value driver in media rights. When only one broadcaster can show content, they capture all the audience—and can charge premium advertising rates.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Exclusivity means one broadcaster controls access in a market. This is why Rogers paid premium for "exclusive Canadian rights"—no competitor could show NHL games, giving Rogers monopoly pricing power.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Exclusivity refers to broadcasting rights, not attendance or ownership. It means only one media company can show the content in a specific geographic market.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

## Element 4J: MC Question 6 - Guaranteed vs Revenue Share `[v3.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
What's the difference between a "guaranteed fee" deal and a "revenue share" deal?
```

**Options:**
- A: Guaranteed fee = broadcaster pays fixed amount; revenue share = payment varies with performance ✅
- B: They're the same thing
- C: Guaranteed fee is always better for leagues
- D: Revenue share means the league takes all the risk

**After Submission:**
```
Deal structure determines who bears risk and who captures upside. Guaranteed fees provide certainty; revenue share deals align incentives but introduce variability.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Guaranteed fee = predictable income regardless of performance. Revenue share = payment tied to actual results (ratings, subscribers, ad sales). Leagues choose based on risk tolerance and growth expectations.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
These are fundamentally different structures. Guaranteed = fixed payment (league bears no risk but has no upside). Revenue share = variable payment (league shares both risk and reward).
```

### Challenge 4: Evaluate the Rogers Deal

**The Problem:** Rogers' $5.2B NHL deal expires in 2026. They've lost an estimated $1.5B over 10 years. Should they renew, walk away, or renegotiate? Can you analyze what went wrong and recommend a path forward?

**What you'll need to know:**
- The biggest risks broadcasters face when paying billions for rights
- What assumptions Rogers got wrong
- How to evaluate whether a deal should be renewed or restructured

**Test yourself:** Can you identify ONE major assumption Rogers got wrong—and how you'd avoid the same mistake?

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
What is the biggest risk for broadcasters paying billions for sports rights?
```

**Options:**
- A: The sport becomes less popular
- B: Cord-cutting reduces their subscriber base ✅
- C: Players go on strike
- D: Weather cancels games

**After Submission:**
```
Broadcaster economics depend on distribution reach. When subscribers cancel cable ("cord-cutting"), the revenue base that supports rights fees shrinks—even if the sport remains popular.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Rogers' model assumed stable cable subscriber bases. But cord-cutting accelerated faster than projected, reducing both subscription revenue and advertising reach. The sport stayed popular; the distribution model collapsed.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
While popularity and labor issues matter, they're less predictable and less impactful than structural changes. Cord-cutting directly attacks broadcaster economics regardless of content quality.

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
If Rogers' deal expires in 2026, what should they do?
```

**Options:**
- A: Renew at the same price (sunk cost doesn't matter)
- B: Walk away entirely (cut losses)
- C: Renegotiate for lower fees and more flexibility ✅
- D: Sell the rights to a competitor

**After Submission:**
```
Past losses are sunk costs—they shouldn't drive future decisions. The question is whether NHL rights are worth it at a DIFFERENT price with DIFFERENT terms that reflect current market realities.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Sunk costs are irrelevant to future decisions. Rogers should negotiate a deal that reflects 2026 realities: lower linear value, streaming economics, and flexibility clauses for market changes. The content still has value—just not $433M/year of value.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Walking away abandons a valuable asset; renewing at the same price repeats the mistake. The content has value—but at a price reflecting current (not 2013) market conditions.
