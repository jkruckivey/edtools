# The $5.2 Billion Bet: Analyzing the Rogers NHL Deal

You've just simulated building a sports streaming platform from scratch in Streaming Wars Strategy, experiencing firsthand the tension between content costs, subscriber growth, and profitability timelines. Now you'll analyze a **real-world $5.2 billion bet** where those same decisions played out with far higher stakes.

In this module, you'll examine Rogers Communications' 2013 acquisition of exclusive NHL rights—the largest sports media deal in Canadian history. You'll explore what Rogers bought for $5.2B, why they believed it would work, what actually happened over 10 years, and what Rogers should do when the contract expires in 2026. This comprehensive case study will test your ability to evaluate mega-deals using all Week 2 frameworks.

**Estimated Time:** ~23 minutes (can be completed in one session or split across multiple)

## Element 2: Infobox - Case Overview

```
Title: Case Study: Rogers Communications - The $5.2 Billion NHL Bet ▸

Context:
In 2013, Rogers Communications shocked the sports media world by paying $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—12 years, all platforms, all games. It was the largest sports media deal in Canadian history and a massive strategic bet on hockey's enduring value.

Key Questions for Analysis:
1. How did Rogers value the NHL rights at $5.2 billion? What assumptions did they make?
2. What were the strategic goals beyond pure ROI (e.g., brand positioning, competitive defense)?
3. How did the deal perform vs. expectations? What went right and wrong?
4. What should Rogers do in 2026 when the deal expires?

This case addresses all Week 2 WLOs:
• WLO 2.1: Rights valuation methodology
• WLO 2.2: Platform strategy (linear Sportsnet + streaming)
• WLO 2.3: Fan engagement and monetization tactics
• WLO 2.4: Evaluation of mega-deal success/failure

```markdown
# Rogers Communications: Company Background (2013)

**Who:** Rogers Communications, Canada's largest telecommunications and media company. In 2013, Rogers owned:
- Rogers Wireless (largest mobile carrier, 9.5M subscribers)
- Rogers Cable (cable TV and internet, 2.3M subscribers)
- **Sportsnet** (sports broadcasting network, distant #2 to TSN)

**Strategic Challenge:** By 2013, Rogers faced existential threats:
- Cord-cutting accelerating (cable subscribers declining 5%/year)
- TSN (Bell Media) dominated sports broadcasting with NHL, NBA, CFL, FIFA
- Netflix and streaming disrupting traditional TV

**The Opportunity:** NHL's Canadian rights deal with CBC/TSN was expiring in 2014. Rogers saw a chance to acquire the crown jewel of Canadian sports and transform Sportsnet from challenger to leader.

**The Stakes:** A $5.2B bet—equivalent to 15% of Rogers' entire market capitalization. Success could secure Rogers' media future. Failure could cripple the company for a decade.

**Next: Explore the deal terms and what Rogers got for $5.2 billion.**

# Practice: Explore the $5.2 Billion Deal

Rogers paid $5.2 billion for 12 years of NHL rights—$433 million per year, 209% more than the previous deal. What exactly did that money buy? And was it worth it? Let's find out.

## Your Challenge

You're a media analyst presenting to Rogers' board in 2014. They've just approved the NHL deal and want you to explain exactly what $5.2 billion purchased. You'll use the **Rogers Deal Terms Explorer** to walk through every component of the agreement.

## What You'll Practice

- Understanding the components of a major media rights deal
- Analyzing why exclusivity commands premium pricing
- Evaluating Rogers' original financial projections
- Comparing the deal to its predecessor to assess whether Rogers "overpaid"

## How the Explorer Works

1. **Rights Included Tab:** See every game package Rogers acquired (1,000+ games/season)
2. **Platforms Covered Tab:** Explore distribution across linear TV, streaming, digital, and radio
3. **Exclusivity Terms Tab:** Understand Rogers' near-monopoly on NHL in Canada (TSN lost access entirely)
4. **Revenue Projections Tab:** Review Rogers' internal forecasts (break-even by Year 5, 1M streaming subscribers)
5. **Deal Comparison Tab:** See how 2014 terms compared to the previous CBC/TSN deal

## Strategic Considerations

- **Exclusivity was the expensive part:** Rogers didn't just buy rights—they bought out TSN and blocked competitors. That defensive move cost billions.
- **Internal projections were aggressive:** Rogers assumed cord-cutting would slow and streaming growth would accelerate. Neither happened as planned.
- **The "strategic" case vs. the "financial" case:** Even if the deal lost money, Rogers argued it protected their core cable business. Was that worth $1.5B in losses?
- **Hindsight is 20/20:** In 2014, the deal looked aggressive but defensible. By 2020, it looked like the worst media rights deal in Canadian history.

## After the Explorer

Note which deal components surprised you most. When we analyze performance in the next tool, you'll see which of Rogers' assumptions proved accurate—and which failed catastrophically.

## Element 5: Tool 5 - Rogers Deal Terms Explorer

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Rogers Deal Terms Explorer

**Practice: WLO 2.4 (Evaluate the Rogers $5.2B NHL deal and its implications)**

You've learned how media rights are valued and how platforms make money. Now analyze the most famous—and controversial—media rights deal in Canadian history: Rogers' $5.2 billion, 12-year exclusive NHL agreement. What exactly did $5.2 billion buy? Was it worth it?

In this interactive activity, you'll explore 5 tabs revealing what Rogers acquired: Rights Included (1,000+ games per season), Platforms Covered (linear TV, streaming, digital, radio), Exclusivity Terms (near-monopoly on NHL in Canada), Revenue Projections (Rogers forecasted break-even by Year 5), and Comparison to Previous Deal (209% more expensive than CBC/TSN's prior deal). Click through each tab to understand the deal's scope.

**What you'll discover:**

- The sheer SCOPE of $433M/year—Rogers bought every meaningful NHL touchpoint in Canada
- Why exclusivity commanded such a premium (TSN lost access entirely; Rogers could control distribution strategy)
- Rogers' internal revenue projections assumed 1M Sportsnet NOW subscribers by Year 5—spoiler: they never reached half that
- That the deal was 209% more expensive than the previous one—either Rogers overpaid or the NHL was vastly undervalued before

**Time commitment:** 5-6 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.4 (Evaluate Rogers deal terms, projections, and strategic rationale)

---

**🎮 Tool Purpose:** Let students explore the comprehensive terms of the Rogers NHL deal interactively, understanding what $5.2B bought.

**Status:** ⭕ Phase 2 tool - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (5-6 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. **Deal Overview Screen:**
   - Total value: $5.2 billion over 12 years
   - Annual cost: $433 million/year
   - Contract term: 2014-15 season → 2025-26 season
2. **Interactive Tabs (Click to Explore):**
   - **Rights Included:** What Rogers acquired
   - **Platforms Covered:** Where games could be shown
   - **Exclusivity Terms:** What competitors lost
   - **Revenue Projections:** What Rogers expected to earn
   - **Comparison to Previous Deal:** How much more Rogers paid

**Tab Content:**

**Tab 1: Rights Included**
- ✅ All national games (Hockey Night in Canada - Saturday nights)
- ✅ All regional games (all 7 Canadian teams - 82 games × 7 = 574 regional games)
- ✅ All playoff games (Stanley Cup Playoffs - Canadian teams + all rounds)
- ✅ International tournaments (World Cup of Hockey, Olympics qualifier games)
- ✅ Shoulder programming (pre-game, post-game, highlight shows)
- **Total:** 1,000+ games per season + shoulder content

**Tab 2: Platforms Covered**

- 📱 Streaming: Sportsnet NOW (subscription service, launched 2016)
- 💻 Digital: Sportsnet.ca website, mobile apps
- 📻 Radio: Sportsnet Radio network
- **Flexibility:** Rogers controlled all platforms (could shift games based on strategy)

**Tab 3: Exclusivity Terms**
- 🚫 TSN lost national rights (previously co-held with CBC)
- 🚫 CBC retained Hockey Night in Canada brand but sublicensed from Rogers (free over-air broadcast Saturdays)
- 🚫 No other Canadian broadcaster could show NHL games (except CBC sublicense)
- ✅ Regional rights for some teams retained by others (e.g., TSN had regional Ottawa Senators rights)
- **Result:** Rogers had near-monopoly on NHL content in Canada

**Tab 4: Revenue Projections (Rogers' Internal Forecast)**
- **Year 1 (2014-15):** $300M revenue (advertising + Sportsnet NOW subscriptions)
- **Year 3 (2016-17):** $425M revenue (subscriber growth + premium ad rates)
- **Year 5 (2018-19):** $500M revenue (break-even point)
- **Year 7 (2020-21):** $550M revenue (sustained profitability)
- **Assumptions:** 1M Sportsnet NOW subscribers by Year 5 @ $25/month + stable linear TV ad revenue

**Tab 5: Comparison to Previous Deal**
- **Previous (CBC/TSN 2004-2014):** $1.4B over 10 years = $140M/year
- **Rogers (2014-2026):** $5.2B over 12 years = $433M/year
- **Increase:** 209% higher per year ($433M vs. $140M)
- **Per-game cost:** Previous: $140K/game → Rogers: $433K/game (3x increase)
- **Justification:** Exclusivity premium + digital rights + inflation + NHL's growing Canadian fanbase

**Learning Outcomes:**
- **WLO 2.4:** Understand comprehensive scope of rights deal (not just TV games)
- **WLO 2.1:** Recognize valuation factors (exclusivity, platform flexibility, content volume)
- Appreciate why Rogers paid 3x more than previous deal (exclusivity + digital platforms)
- Understand revenue projection assumptions (critical for later analysis when projections fail)

**Accessibility:**
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab to switch tabs, Enter to activate)
- ✅ ARIA tabs pattern (role="tablist", aria-selected)
- ✅ Screen reader announces tab content when switching
- ✅ High contrast mode for tab indicators
- ✅ Focus indicators on active tab

### 💡 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS TUTORIAL: How to Read Case Exhibits

**Quick Guide (2 minutes)** - Before you analyze Rogers' performance, learn how to read financial projections like an MBA analyst.

**1. Variance Analysis (Projected vs. Actual)**
- **What it is:** Compare what was forecasted to what actually happened
- **How to calculate:** Variance = Actual - Projected (negative = shortfall, positive = beat expectations)
- **What to look for:** Consistent misses suggest flawed assumptions (not just bad luck)
- **Example:** Rogers projected $500M Year 5 revenue, actual was $350M → -$150M variance (30% shortfall)

**2. Break-Even Analysis**
- **What it is:** When does revenue exceed costs? When does cumulative profit turn positive?
- **Red flag:** Break-even keeps getting pushed back (Year 5 → Year 7 → Never)
- **Rogers reality:** Projected break-even Year 5. Actual: Never achieved after 10 years.

**3. Key Metrics to Track**
- **Revenue growth rate:** Is it accelerating or decelerating?
- **Cost structure:** Are costs fixed or variable? Can they flex down if revenue misses?
- **Cumulative profit/loss:** Add up annual profits/losses to see total financial impact
- **ROI calculation:** (Total Return - Total Investment) / Total Investment

**4. Common Red Flags**
- ⚠️ **Overly optimistic growth rates** (e.g., "subscribers will grow 100%/year for 5 years")
- ⚠️ **No downside scenarios** (what if things go wrong?)
- ⚠️ **Missing force majeure clauses** (COVID, strikes, lockouts)
- ⚠️ **Revenue projections that assume "build it and they will come"** without customer acquisition strategy

**🎯 Use This Framework:** As you explore Rogers' financial data in the next tools, ask yourself: Where did projections go wrong? What assumptions failed? Could this have been predicted?

```markdown
# Why Rogers Paid $5.2 Billion: The Strategic Rationale

Rogers' board approved the $5.2B bid despite knowing it would lose money for 3-5 years. **Why?**

## Defensive Strategy: Protect the Core Business
- Cable subscribers were cancelling at 5%/year (cord-cutting accelerating)
- NHL games were **the #1 reason Canadians kept cable** (survey: 42% said "hockey" was must-have)
- Losing NHL rights would accelerate cord-cutting → death spiral for cable business
- **Logic:** Pay $433M/year to prevent $1B+/year cable revenue loss

## Offensive Strategy: Build Streaming Brand
- Sportsnet NOW (streaming service) launched 2016 with NHL as exclusive content
- Target: 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 @ $25/month = $300M/year new revenue
- Position Sportsnet as **Canada's sports streaming destination** before Netflix, DAZN, Apple entered

## Competitive Defense: Hurt TSN (Bell Media)
- TSN (Rogers' main competitor) lost national NHL rights
- Weakened TSN's #1 sports brand positioning
- Rogers could justify cable carriage fee increases ("We have NHL, TSN doesn't")

**Next: What actually happened? (Spoiler: Most assumptions proved wrong)**

## Element 6: Text - Performance Overview (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# What Actually Happened: 2014-2024 Performance

Rogers' optimistic projections collided with harsh market realities.

## Financial Performance (vs. Projections)
- **Year 1:** Revenue $280M (projected $300M) ❌ Below target
- **Year 3:** Revenue $310M (projected $425M) ❌ 27% shortfall
- **Year 5:** Revenue $350M (projected $500M) ❌ 30% shortfall
- **Year 7 (COVID):** Revenue $200M (projected $550M) ❌ 64% shortfall
- **Year 10:** Revenue $380M (projected $600M+) ❌ Still unprofitable

## Three Critical Failures
1. **Advertising Revenue Collapsed:** Cord-cutting reduced linear TV viewership faster than Sportsnet NOW growth offset it
2. **Streaming Underperformance:** 450K subscribers vs. 1M target (55% shortfall) → $150M/year revenue gap
3. **No Flexibility:** Contract had no force majeure clause—COVID losses couldn't be renegotiated

**Cumulative Result:** Analyst estimates suggest $1.5B+ in total losses over 10 years. The deal significantly underperformed profitability expectations.

**Next: Explore the data behind these failures.**

```markdown
# Practice: Track Where the Deal Went Wrong

Rogers projected break-even by Year 5 with $500M in revenue. By Year 10, they were still losing $50-150M annually. But where exactly did the projections go wrong? And when should Rogers have known?

## Your Challenge

You're a financial analyst preparing a post-mortem for Rogers' executive team. They ask: "Show us exactly where our assumptions failed." You'll use the **Projections vs. Actuals Visualizer** to build a year-by-year variance analysis.

## What You'll Practice

- Comparing financial projections to actual results over a 10-year period
- Identifying variance drivers (cord-cutting, streaming adoption, COVID-19)
- Recognizing early warning signs that a deal is underperforming
- Understanding cumulative loss calculations in media rights deals

## How the Visualizer Works

1. **Timeline Scrubber:** Move through Years 1-10 (2014-2024) to see how performance evolved
2. **Three Lines:** Blue = Rogers' original projections, Red = Actual revenue, Green = Break-even threshold ($433M/year)
3. **Hover for Details:** Each year shows projected revenue, actual revenue, variance percentage, and key events
4. **Variance Breakdown:** See which factors drove underperformance (cord-cutting, streaming, advertising rates)
5. **Cumulative Loss Tracker:** Watch total losses accumulate over the deal's lifetime

## Strategic Considerations

- **Year 1 warning signs:** Even in Year 1, actuals fell 15% short of projections. Was this a temporary miss or a structural problem?
- **The cord-cutting acceleration:** Rogers projected 3% annual cord-cutting. Actual rates were 5-8%. That 2-5 point gap compounded catastrophically over 12 years.
- **Streaming never materialized:** Rogers projected 1M Sportsnet NOW subscribers by Year 5. They peaked at ~400,000. The streaming pivot that was supposed to save the deal never happened.
- **COVID was bad—but not the main problem:** Year 7 (COVID) crushed revenue by 64%. But even in normal years, Rogers never hit break-even. COVID exposed the problem; it didn't create it.

## After the Visualizer

Note the year when Rogers should have recognized the deal was failing. In 2026, they'll face a renewal decision. How should this performance data inform that choice?
```

## Element 9: Tool 6 - Projections vs. Actuals Visualizer

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Projections vs. Actuals Visualizer

**Practice: WLO 2.4 (Evaluate Rogers deal performance)**

Rogers projected break-even by Year 5 ($500M revenue). By Year 10, they were still losing $50-150M annually. But where exactly did the projections go wrong? And by how much?

In this interactive activity, you'll scrub through a 10-year timeline (2014-2024) comparing three lines: Rogers' original revenue projections (blue), actual revenue achieved (red), and the break-even threshold at $433M/year (green horizontal line). Hover over any year to see detailed variance breakdowns and key events (e.g., Year 7: COVID-19 devastated revenue, projected $550M, actual $200M, -64% variance).

**What you'll discover:**

- Rogers' projections were optimistic from Day 1—even Year 1 actuals fell short by 15%
- The gap WIDENED over time—by Year 5, actuals were 40% below projections
- COVID-19 wasn't the main problem (though it crushed Year 7)—cord-cutting and failed streaming adoption were
- Rogers NEVER crossed the break-even line in 10 years—losses totaled ~$1.5B

**Time commitment:** 7-8 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.4 (Evaluate mega-deal performance through variance analysis)

**Details Element Title:** `Need help? How to use this visualizer`

```
This visualizer shows exactly where Rogers' projections went wrong — and by how much.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Understand the three lines:**
   - **Blue line:** Rogers' original revenue projections (what they expected)
   - **Red line:** Actual revenue achieved (what really happened)
   - **Green horizontal line:** Break-even threshold ($433M/year)

2. **Scrub through the timeline:** Use the slider to move through Years 1-10

3. **Hover over any year** to see detailed breakdown:
   - Projected vs. actual revenue
   - Variance amount and percentage
   - Key event that year (COVID, cord-cutting acceleration, etc.)

4. **Look for patterns:**
   - When did the gap start? (Hint: Year 1)
   - Did it narrow or widen over time?
   - What was the single worst year? Why?

**What to notice:**
- Rogers NEVER crossed the green break-even line in 10 years
- The gap widened every year until Year 7 (COVID) when it collapsed entirely
- Even without COVID, the trajectory was headed for ~$1B cumulative losses

**If you're stuck:** Look at Year 5 (supposed break-even year). What was the variance? What does that tell you about the original assumptions?

## Element 8: Infobox (Note) - Key Insight: Why Forecasts Failed

```
Title: ▶ Critical Insight: The Forecasting Failure

Rogers' projections failed for three interconnected reasons:

1. **Underestimated Cord-Cutting Speed**
   - Assumed linear TV would decline 15% over 10 years
   - Actual: 28% decline (nearly double)
   - Impact: $150M/year advertising revenue shortfall

2. **Overestimated Streaming Adoption**
   - Assumed NHL-only service would attract 1M+ subscribers
   - Actual: Hockey alone wasn't enough—fans wanted multi-sport (DAZN model)
   - Impact: $150M/year subscription revenue shortfall

3. **No Scenario Planning for Black Swan Events**
   - Contract had no force majeure clause (COVID, lockouts, other disruptions)
   - Impact: $350M loss in Year 7 with no recourse

**Lesson:** Media rights deals require scenario planning. Rogers optimized for "base case" and had no hedge for downside risks. NHL's next deal will include flexibility clauses.

### Element 10A: Practice Quiz - Rogers Deal Analysis Check

**Uplift Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise - Practice Quiz** element
2. Configure as ungraded self-assessment
3. Add the following 5 multiple choice questions:

**Purpose:** Ensure students understand key case data before proceeding to 2026 decision analysis and AI roleplay.

---

### Question 1: Deal Cost Premium

How much more per year did Rogers pay compared to the previous CBC/TSN deal?

A) 50% more ($210M/year vs. $140M/year)
B) 100% more ($280M/year vs. $140M/year)
C) 209% more ($433M/year vs. $140M/year) ✅
D) 300% more ($560M/year vs. $140M/year)

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Rogers paid $433M/year versus the previous $140M/year—a 209% premium. This massive increase reflected exclusivity (TSN locked out entirely), digital rights (streaming platforms), and competitive bidding pressure from Bell/TSN.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review the Deal Terms comparison. The previous deal was $1.4B over 10 years ($140M/year). Rogers' deal was $5.2B over 12 years. Calculate the per-year cost and compare.

---

### Question 2: Streaming Target Miss

By Year 10, how did Sportsnet NOW subscribers compare to Rogers' original Year 5 target?

A) Exceeded target (1.2M vs. 1M target)
B) Met target exactly (1M subscribers)
C) Missed by 25% (750K vs. 1M target)
D) Missed by 55% (450K vs. 1M target) ✅

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Rogers projected 1 million Sportsnet NOW subscribers by Year 5. By Year 10, they had only reached 450,000—a 55% shortfall. This represents ~$150M/year in missing subscription revenue and was a major driver of deal losses.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review the streaming performance data. Rogers' original target was 1M subscribers by Year 5. Compare that to actual performance—even by Year 10, they hadn't reached the Year 5 goal.

---

### Question 3: Break-Even Achievement

According to the case, when did Rogers achieve break-even ($433M annual revenue) on the NHL deal?

A) Year 5 (as originally projected)
B) Year 7 (delayed due to COVID)
C) Year 10 (finally achieved)
D) Never achieved in 10 years ✅

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Rogers NEVER crossed the $433M break-even threshold in 10 years. Best year was approximately $380M (Year 10), still $53M short. Cumulative estimated losses exceeded $1.5 billion.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Look at the Projections vs. Actuals data. The green break-even line sits at $433M/year. In which year (if ever) did the actual revenue line cross that threshold?

---

### Question 4: Primary Failure Driver

According to the case, which factor contributed MOST to Rogers' financial shortfall?

A) Player strikes and lockouts
B) Poor marketing of Sportsnet brand
C) Cord-cutting reducing linear TV revenue faster than streaming growth offset it ✅
D) Competition from American streaming services

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Rogers assumed cord-cutting would reduce cable subscribers by 15% over 10 years; actual decline was 28% (nearly double). This devastated advertising revenue while Sportsnet NOW streaming growth couldn't compensate. The model assumed linear TV would hold while streaming grew—instead, linear collapsed faster than streaming could scale.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review the "Three Critical Failures" section. While all factors contributed, one was the foundational assumption that collapsed. Think about what Rogers was trying to PROTECT with the NHL deal and what happened to that business.

---

### Question 5: Strategic Defense Rationale

What percentage of Canadians cited hockey as the "must-have" reason for keeping cable, according to Rogers' 2013 research?

A) 15%
B) 28%
C) 42% ✅
D) 65%

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Rogers' research showed 42% of Canadians said hockey was the must-have content keeping them subscribed to cable. This justified the defensive strategy: pay $433M/year to protect billions in cable revenue from cord-cutting. The logic was sound—the execution failed because cord-cutting accelerated anyway.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review the Strategic Rationale section. Rogers justified the premium price partly as a defensive move to protect their cable business. What survey data supported this defensive logic?

## Element 9: Text - Audience Trends (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Viewership Trends: The Audience Story

Beyond financial projections, Rogers faced declining and fragmented audiences.

## National Broadcast Ratings (Hockey Night in Canada)
- **2013-14 (Pre-Rogers):** 1.8M average viewers (baseline)
- **2014-15 (Year 1):** 1.6M viewers (-11%) ⬇️ Weak Canadian teams
- **2023-24 (Year 10):** 1.3M viewers (-28% vs. baseline) ⬇️ Continued erosion

## Why Viewership Declined
1. **Canadian Team Performance:** Only 1-2 Canadian teams made playoffs most years (reduces "must-watch" games)
2. **Generational Shift:** Younger audiences (18-34) prefer highlights and social clips over 3-hour games
3. **Competition:** More viewing options (Netflix, gaming, other sports) fragment attention

## Sportsnet NOW Subscriber Growth (Too Slow)
- **2016 (Launch):** 50K subscribers
- **2020 (Target Year 5):** 350K subscribers (vs. 1M target)
- **2024 (Current):** 450K subscribers ⬆️ Growth stalled

**Lesson:** Exclusive content isn't enough if underlying audience is declining. Rogers needed multi-sport strategy like DAZN.

**Next: Explore viewership data interactively.**

```markdown
# Practice: Analyze the Audience Trends

Rogers lost $1.5B on the NHL deal. But what were the underlying **audience trends** driving those losses? Did viewership decline? Did younger fans stop watching? Did streaming adoption stall? The financial data tells you WHAT happened—the audience data tells you WHY.

## Your Challenge

You're a market research analyst briefing Rogers' strategy team. They ask: "Who stopped watching, and where did they go?" You'll use the **Viewership Trends Analyzer** to build a comprehensive audience profile.

## What You'll Practice

- Analyzing linear TV ratings trends over a 10-year period
- Tracking streaming subscriber growth vs. targets
- Understanding demographic shifts (age, gender, region)
- Identifying which audience segments are most valuable—and which are disappearing

## How the Analyzer Works

1. **Linear TV Ratings Tab:** Hockey Night in Canada Saturday viewership 2014-2024
2. **Streaming Subscribers Tab:** Sportsnet NOW growth curve vs. Rogers' 1M target
3. **Demographic Breakdown Tab:** Filter by age group, gender, and region
4. **Year Filter:** Compare any year to 2014 baseline
5. **Trend Lines:** See whether changes are gradual erosion or sudden collapse

## Strategic Considerations

- **The 18-34 crisis:** Viewers aged 18-34 declined 50% over 10 years. Viewers 55+ held steady. Hockey's audience is aging out—and that demographic shift has profound implications for advertising rates.
- **Streaming didn't save them:** Rogers projected 1M Sportsnet NOW subscribers. They peaked at 450K. Why? Hockey alone wasn't enough to justify a streaming subscription—subscribers wanted broader content libraries.
- **Regional disparities matter:** Toronto and Montreal ratings held relatively steady. Vancouver and Calgary declined sharply. Not all Canadian hockey markets are equal.
- **Steady erosion, not sudden collapse:** Ratings didn't crash—they declined 3-5% annually. That steady erosion was harder to react to than a dramatic drop would have been.

## After the Analyzer

Identify the 2-3 audience trends that explain Rogers' losses. When we evaluate the 2026 renewal decision, you'll need to project whether these trends will continue, accelerate, or reverse.

## Element 11: Text - Competitive Landscape (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# The Competitive Landscape: TSN, DAZN, and New Entrants

While Rogers struggled with the NHL deal, competitors evolved with diversified strategies.

## TSN (Bell Media): The Diversification Winner
- **Lost:** NHL national rights to Rogers (painful in 2014)
- **Pivoted:** Acquired CFL, NBA, FIFA World Cup, MLS regional, curling, tennis
- **Result:** Multi-sport strategy created stable revenue (no single property = 50% of costs)
- **TSN Direct (streaming):** Launched 2018, reached 400K subscribers by 2024 (vs. Sportsnet NOW 450K)

## DAZN Canada: The Disruptor
- **Launched:** 2017 with soccer (EPL, Champions League, Serie A) + boxing + NFL
- **Strategy:** Lower price ($24.99 vs. Sportsnet $27.99), multi-sport, niche fan targeting
- **Subscribers:** 300K by 2020 (competitive with Sportsnet NOW despite later launch)

## Apple TV+ / Amazon: The Tech Giants
- **Apple:** MLS exclusive deal ($2.5B, 2023-2032) → Global strategy, not ROI-focused
- **Amazon:** NFL Thursday Night Football → Subscription driver for Prime

**Lesson:** Rogers' single-property bet looked increasingly risky as market fragmented and tech giants entered with deep pockets.

**Next: Compare Rogers' strategy to competitors.**

## Element 12: Table - Rogers vs. Competitors Comparison

| **Company** | **Rights Portfolio** | **Annual Rights Costs** | **Streaming Strategy** | **2024 Subscribers** | **Profitability** | **Strategic Approach** |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Rogers (Sportsnet)** | NHL exclusive | $433M/year | Sportsnet NOW (NHL-only) | 450K | ❌ Unprofitable (10 years) | Single-property bet, defensive strategy |
| **Bell (TSN)** | Multi-sport (CFL, NBA, FIFA, MLS) | $250M/year total | TSN Direct (multi-sport) | 400K | ✅ Profitable Year 3 | Diversification, lower risk |
| **DAZN Canada** | Soccer, boxing, NFL, combat sports | $50M/year | DAZN multi-sport | 300K | ✅ Profitable Year 4 | Niche targeting, global content |
| **Apple TV+** | MLS exclusive (global) | $250M/year | Apple TV+ bundle | 2M+ (MLS Season Pass) | ❌ Strategic investment (not ROI-focused) | Tech giant deep pockets, global strategy |

**Table Caption:** "Canadian Sports Streaming Competitive Landscape (2024)"

**Key Takeaway:**
Rogers' single-property, NHL-exclusive strategy created concentration risk. TSN's multi-sport portfolio and DAZN's niche targeting proved more resilient. Tech giants (Apple, Amazon) can afford "strategic losses" that traditional broadcasters cannot.

## Element 13: Text - The 2026 Decision (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# 2026: Renew, Renegotiate, or Walk Away?

Rogers' NHL contract expires after the 2025-26 season. The company must decide its next move.

## Three Options on the Table

**Option 1: Renew at Reduced Price**
- NHL knows Rogers overpaid and lost money
- Next deal likely $300-350M/year (30% reduction)
- **Pros:** Keep NHL content, spread costs over longer term (15 years?), flexibility clauses (force majeure)
- **Cons:** Still a massive bet, streaming market even more competitive, younger demos not watching full games

**Option 2: Split Rights Package**
- Rogers takes regional (7 Canadian teams) + streaming
- TSN or Amazon takes national (Saturday nights)
- **Pros:** Lower cost ($200M/year range), shared risk, broader distribution
- **Cons:** Lose exclusivity competitive advantage, coordination challenges

**Option 3: Walk Away Completely**
- Let TSN, DAZN, Apple, or Amazon bid for NHL
- Rogers focuses on other sports or exits sports media
- **Pros:** Cut losses, reallocate capital, focus on wireless/cable core business
- **Cons:** Lose sports brand identity, accelerate cable cord-cutting (NHL was subscriber retention tool)

**Your Task:** What would YOU recommend? Use the decision simulator to explore trade-offs.

```markdown
# Practice: Make the 2026 Decision (CAPSTONE)

The year is 2026. Rogers' $5.2 billion NHL contract expires. After estimated losses exceeding $1.5 billion over 12 years, the CEO asks: "Should we renew? If so, at what price and on what terms? Or should we walk away?" There's no right answer—only defensible strategic recommendations supported by evidence.

## Your Challenge

You're Rogers' Chief Strategy Officer presenting to the board. You have 3 options: renew with exclusive rights ($300-350M/year), split the package with competitors ($200M/year), or walk away entirely. Each choice has profound implications for Rogers' future. What do you recommend?

## What You'll Practice

- Synthesizing ALL Week 2 frameworks into a single strategic recommendation
- Setting market assumptions and defending them with evidence
- Comparing financial projections across different strategic options
- Writing a clear, persuasive executive recommendation (250 words)

## How the Simulator Works

1. **Set Market Assumptions:** Choose your projections for cord-cutting rate (3-8%), streaming growth, NHL viewership trends, competitive intensity, and betting revenue
2. **Choose Your Strategy:** Select renew exclusive, split package, or walk away
3. **View 10-Year Projections:** See financial impact of your choice (revenue, costs, cumulative profit/loss)
4. **Compare Alternatives:** View all three options side-by-side with your assumptions
5. **Write Recommendation:** Draft 250-word executive summary justifying your choice
6. **Export PDF:** Download complete analysis for your Week 2 reflection

## Strategic Considerations

- **Renew Exclusive ($300-350M/year):** Lower price than 2014 reflects market reality. Maintains sports brand identity. Still risky if cord-cutting accelerates.
- **Split Package ($200M/year):** Share costs and risks with TSN/Bell. Lose exclusivity advantage. More financially defensible.
- **Walk Away ($0):** Cut losses entirely. Reallocate capital to wireless/5G. Risk accelerating cord-cutting (NHL was retention tool).
- **Betting changes everything:** If Rogers can integrate betting partnerships, the economics improve dramatically. But regulatory uncertainty remains.
- **Streaming pivot:** Has Rogers learned from Sportsnet NOW's failures? Can they build a compelling streaming product in 2026?

## After the Simulator

Export your full analysis. Your recommendation will form the foundation of your Week 2 reflection memo. Be prepared to defend your assumptions—reasonable people can disagree on market projections, but your logic must be sound.

This is your Week 2 capstone — synthesize everything you've learned to make a strategic recommendation.

**Step-by-step:**

**Phase 1: Set Your Assumptions**
- Adjust sliders for cord-cutting rate, streaming growth, viewership trends, competitive intensity, and betting revenue potential
- These assumptions drive your 10-year projections — be thoughtful about what you believe will happen

**Phase 2: Choose Your Option**
- **Option 1: Renew Exclusive** ($300-350M/year) — Keep full control, highest risk/reward
- **Option 2: Split Package** ($200M/year) — Share with partner, lower risk/reward
- **Option 3: Walk Away** — Exit NHL, redeploy capital elsewhere

**Phase 3: View Projections**
- See 10-year revenue, costs, and cumulative profit/loss for your choice
- Note the break-even year (or if it never reaches break-even)
- Review the strategic scorecard (5 criteria rated)

**Phase 4: Compare Alternatives**
- Side-by-side comparison of all 3 options under YOUR assumptions
- See which performs best financially and strategically

**Phase 5: Write Your Recommendation**
- 250-word executive summary justifying your choice
- Export full analysis as PDF for your memo

**What to notice:**
- Your assumptions dramatically change which option looks best
- There's no single "right answer" — it depends on risk tolerance and strategic priorities
- The best recommendations acknowledge trade-offs and counterarguments

**If you're stuck:** Start with "base case" assumptions (middle of each slider), see which option wins, then stress-test by moving assumptions to pessimistic and optimistic extremes.

Students will synthesize Week 2 media rights frameworks to analyze the Rogers NHL deal performance and develop a defensible strategic recommendation for the 2026 contract decision. This supports WLO 2.4 (Evaluate the Rogers $5.2B NHL deal) at the Evaluation/Synthesis level.

**Scenario Setup:** Strategy Briefing

---

### Tab 2: Scenario

**Context:**
It's late 2025. Rogers Communications' $5.2 billion NHL contract expires next year, and the executive team needs to decide: renew, renegotiate, or walk away? You've been analyzing this deal as part of your consulting engagement.

Patricia Chen, VP of Strategy at a Canadian media consulting firm, assigned you this analysis. She's followed the Rogers deal for years and knows it inside out—but she wants to hear YOUR take before the team presents to Rogers' board. This is a collaborative briefing, not a test. She genuinely wants to understand your reasoning.

**Role of AI (Patricia Chen):** Patricia Chen is a sharp, experienced media strategist who's followed the Rogers NHL deal since 2013. She's curious, supportive, but will push back on weak arguments. She won't give you answers—she wants to see how you think. She's preparing you to present to Rogers' board.

**Role of Student:** You are a strategy consultant briefing your senior partner on the Rogers NHL deal analysis. Walk her through the deal structure, performance vs. projections, key failures, and your 2026 recommendation. Use data from the case and Week 2 frameworks to support your analysis.

### Tab 3: Hidden Context

**Hidden Context (AI knows, student doesn't see):**

```
CHARACTER: Patricia Chen, VP of Strategy at a Canadian media consulting firm
- Sharp, curious, genuinely invested in developing junior analysts
- You've followed the Rogers NHL deal closely over the years - it's a case you reference often
- You assigned this analysis to the student for their professional development
- You want them to form their OWN conclusions - you have opinions but you're not sharing them yet

YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE STUDENT:
- You're their senior partner - collaborative, not adversarial
- You haven't crunched all the numbers yourself - that's why you assigned this to them
- You're curious to hear their take, not testing or tripping them up
- You need confidence in their analysis before presenting to Rogers' board together

CASE CONTEXT:
Rogers Communications made the largest sports media bet in Canadian history.

THE DEAL:
- Total value: $5.2 billion over 12 years (2014-2026)
- Annual cost: $433 million/year
- Previous CBC/TSN deal: $1.4B over 10 years ($140M/year)
- Premium paid: 209% more than previous deal

ROGERS' ORIGINAL THESIS:
- Defensive play: NHL keeps cable subscribers (42% said hockey was "must-have")
- Offensive play: Build Sportsnet NOW streaming to 1M subscribers by Year 5
- Competitive play: Lock out TSN, weaken Bell Media's sports brand

THE QUESTION:
Contract expires 2026. Should Rogers renew, renegotiate, or walk away?

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - DO NOT REVEAL THESE NUMBERS:
You have this data to ask smart follow-up questions, but you must NEVER:
- State any of these figures yourself
- Confirm or deny if their numbers are correct
- Say "that's right" or "that's wrong"
- Provide the "answer" if they seem stuck

HOW TO USE THE REFERENCE DATA:

If their number is CLOSE (within ~5-10%):
- Accept it naturally: "Okay, so roughly $X billion in losses - what does that tell us?"
- Move to implications: "And what does that mean for the 2026 decision?"

If their number seems OFF (more than ~15% different):
- Show curiosity: "Walk me through how you got to that figure"
- Or: "That's a bit different than what I recall from the data - can you double-check?"
- Or: "Before we present to the board, let's make sure we're solid on that number"

If their number is WAY OFF (wrong order of magnitude):
- Gently probe: "Hmm, that doesn't quite match my memory of the case. Where did that come from?"
- Or: "Let's pause on that one - can you show me where you found it?"

---
CONVERSATION FLOW:

1. OPENER: "Hey, thanks for putting this together. I've been following Rogers for years, so I'm curious to hear your take. Walk me through what you found - start wherever makes sense to you."
   - Let them present their analysis
   - Follow up: "Interesting - what's driving that?" or "Say more about that"

2. PROBE THEIR ANALYSIS:
   - "What assumptions did Rogers make going in? Which ones held up?"
   - "You mentioned [X]. How does that connect to what we learned about platform economics?"
   - "Interesting. What's the counterargument to that?"
   - "If you were presenting this to Rogers' board in 2013, would you have approved this deal?"

3. CHALLENGE THEIR THINKING:
   - "You said Rogers 'overpaid' - compared to what benchmark?"
   - "Is this a case of bad strategy or bad luck? How do you separate those?"
   - "Some people argue Rogers had no choice - they HAD to bid this high. What do you think?"
   - "What would you have needed to see to call this deal a success?"

4. PUSH TOWARD RECOMMENDATION:
   - "Alright, so given all this - what should Rogers do in 2026?"
   - "What would make you change that recommendation?"
   - "If you're wrong, what's the downside? Can Rogers survive that?"
   - "How confident are you? What's your biggest uncertainty?"

5. SYNTHESIS CHECK:
   - "How does this connect to the media rights frameworks from earlier this week?"
   - "What's the one lesson you'd want Rogers' board to take from this?"
   - "If you had to write the headline for your memo in 10 words or less, what would it be?"

WHAT STRONG PERFORMANCE LOOKS LIKE:
- ✅ Clear recommendation: States a specific 2026 option with confidence
- ✅ Uses case data: "The projections vs. actuals show a 30% shortfall by Year 5..."
- ✅ Financial analysis: Provides specific numbers for revenue, losses, subscriber targets
- ✅ Framework application: Connects to Week 2 concepts (rights valuation, platform economics, engagement)
- ✅ Risk awareness: Acknowledges downsides of their recommendation
- ✅ Trade-off analysis: Explains why they rejected other options

WHAT NEEDS PROBING:
- ❌ Vague recommendations: "Can you be more specific? Which option exactly and why?"
- ❌ No numbers: "What's the actual revenue shortfall? I need figures for the board."
- ❌ Ignoring risks: "What could go wrong with this recommendation?"
- ❌ One-dimensional: "Why not [alternative option]? Walk me through that trade-off."

---
RESPONSE STYLE:
- Be direct but warm - you're a mentor, not a professor
- Use phrases like: "Interesting take...", "Push on that a bit...", "What else?"
- Acknowledge good insights: "That's a sharp observation", "You're onto something there"
- If they ask "Is that right?" respond: "You've done the work - what's your confidence level?"
- Keep responses concise - 2-3 sentences, then ask a question
- Never lecture - always end with a question to keep them thinking

IF THEY'RE STUCK:
- "Let's zoom out. What were Rogers' goals going into this deal?"
- "Look back at the projections vs. actuals data. What pattern do you see?"
- "Sometimes it helps to think about what DIDN'T happen. What did Rogers expect that never materialized?"

IF THEY WANT YOU TO DO THE ANALYSIS:
- "I could, but then it would be my analysis, not yours. What's the first point you want to make?"
- "Let's build it together. What's your main argument?"
- "Start with one sentence: 'Rogers should [X] because [Y].' What fills those blanks?"

ENDING THE CONVERSATION:
- When they've articulated a clear, defended recommendation: "You've got a solid argument here. I think we're ready to present to the board."
- If they want to keep going: "Good instinct to keep pushing. What else are you wondering about?"
- Final encouragement: "This is the kind of analysis that makes clients trust our judgment. Nice work thinking it through."

### Your Role
You are a **strategy consultant** briefing your senior partner, Patricia Chen, on your analysis of the Rogers NHL deal. She assigned you this case and wants to hear your findings before presenting to Rogers' board together.

### The Scenario
Rogers' $5.2 billion NHL contract expires in 2026. After 10+ years of analyst-estimated losses, Rogers must decide:
- **Option 1: Renew exclusive rights** at reduced price ($300-350M/year)

You must present your analysis and defend a recommendation.

### What to Have Ready
- **Deal structure:** What did Rogers buy for $5.2B? (exclusivity, platforms, content volume)
- **Performance analysis:** How did projections compare to actuals? Where did they fail?
- **Framework application:** How does this connect to Week 2 concepts (rights valuation, platform economics)?
- **2026 recommendation:** Which option and why? What are the risks?

### Conversation Tips
- **Lead with your analysis** - Patricia wants to hear your thinking, not just conclusions
- **Use specific numbers** - She'll ask for figures to present to the board
- **Acknowledge trade-offs** - The best consultants explain what they rejected and why

## 🌟 MENTAL BREAK #4: Prepare to Write (CRITICAL BREAK)

**You've completed:** ALL Week 2 learning content (framework + simulation + case)
**Coming next:** Mini-Case Memo assessment (2-page written analysis)

**Take a moment to:**
- **Stand and walk for 5 minutes** (critical for mental clarity before writing)
- Stretch your neck, shoulders, and wrists
- Get water, use the restroom, grab a snack
- Review your notes from the Rogers case
- Set up your writing environment (quiet space, no distractions)

**Progress:** You're 90% through Week 2! You've learned media valuation frameworks, simulated platform strategy, and analyzed a real $5.2B deal. Now you'll synthesize everything into an executive memo.

*DO NOT SKIP THIS BREAK. Writing requires fresh mental energy. Take at least 5-10 minutes. Consider this your "pre-game" before the assessment. You've got this!*

**Pro tip:** Before you start writing, take 2 minutes to jot down your 3 main points on scratch paper. This roadmap will make your memo stronger.
