Title: ◉ Week 4 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you will:

**WLO 4.1: Analyze the five athlete revenue streams** (Bloom's: Analyze)
Identify how elite athletes build wealth through endorsements, owned businesses, investments, media/content, and licensing—and which create equity vs. fee-based income.

**WLO 4.2: Evaluate owned assets versus endorsement strategy** (Bloom's: Evaluate)
Compare equity-building strategies (owned businesses that appreciate) against fee-based income (endorsement payments), using NPV and compounding analysis.

**WLO 4.3: Assess women's sports and emerging sports investment opportunities** (Bloom's: Evaluate)
Analyze first-mover opportunities in women's sports (300%+ growth rates) and emerging sports properties, evaluating risk-adjusted returns.

**WLO 4.4: Design post-career transition strategies** (Bloom's: Create)
Develop wealth preservation plans that sustain athlete brand value beyond playing careers, addressing the 78% bankruptcy challenge.

**This week focuses on CLO 4: Building Athlete & Emerging Sports Brand Strategy**

Athletes as Businesses: Building Wealth Beyond the Game

Over the past three weeks, you've built a comprehensive framework for sports business: revenue ecosystems (Week 1), media rights valuation (Week 2), and sponsorship ROI (Week 3). This week, you'll apply these same frameworks to individual athletes as businesses.

Athletes have their own five revenue streams—and just like leagues, they must decide which to prioritize for long-term wealth creation. You'll discover how elite athletes like Serena Williams build substantial net worth that extends decades beyond their playing careers. You'll analyze why women's sports represent the fastest-growing investment opportunity. And you'll learn why some athletes build generational wealth while others—despite earning tens of millions—struggle financially after retirement.

This week's central question: How do elite athletes strategically build brands and businesses that create long-term wealth, not just short-term income?
