## Element 1: When ROI Meets Ethics - The LIV Golf Dilemma

```markdown
# When ROI Meets Ethics: The LIV Golf Dilemma

**From Theory to Ethical Complexity:** In Modules 2 and 3, you built powerful frameworks: CPM calculations, activation budgets, ROI funnels, betting economics, engagement multipliers. These tools answer "HOW do we measure sponsorship value?"

Now comes the harder question: **"SHOULD a brand sponsor a property when ethical concerns exist?"**

LIV Golf is the perfect case study for this question. Backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf spent $2B+ to poach the world's best golfers from the PGA Tour, offering guaranteed contracts 3-5× their previous earnings. From a pure ROI perspective, LIV Golf offers brands:
- Access to golf's biggest names (Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka)
- Lower sponsorship costs than PGA Tour (desperate for legitimacy)
- Exclusive positioning in a new, heavily-marketed property

But there's a catch: critics call LIV Golf "sportswashing"—using sports investments to distract from Saudi Arabia's human rights record (Khashoggi murder, women's rights, LGBTQ+ persecution). Should brands care? Does it affect ROI? How do you measure "reputation risk"?

This module teaches you to apply sponsorship frameworks to ethically complex decisions. You'll analyze the LIV Golf case, evaluate sportswashing dynamics, and build a framework for assessing brand risk when sponsorship targets are controversial.

```markdown
## How to Read This Case: 4 Focus Areas

As you read the LIV Golf case, pay attention to these four strategic dimensions. You'll analyze them using widgets in this module.

**1. PIF Investment Rationale (Pages 1-3)**
Why did Saudi Arabia invest $2B+ in professional golf? Look for:
- "Vision 2030" economic diversification strategy
- Sports investment portfolio (Newcastle United, Formula 1, boxing, wrestling)
- Soft power objectives vs. financial return expectations
- Is this a business investment or a geopolitical strategy?

**2. Player Economics (Pages 3-5)**
LIV Golf offered guaranteed contracts worth 3-5× PGA Tour earnings. Analyze:
- Phil Mickelson: $200M guaranteed (vs. $90M career PGA earnings)
- Total player investment: $800M+ in Year 1 alone
- Is this sustainable? What's the "CAC" for acquiring star talent?
- Apply the LTV framework from Module 3: What return does LIV expect per player?

**3. Sponsor Decision Framework (Pages 5-7)**
Why did most major sponsors avoid LIV Golf while some signed? Evaluate:
- Who signed: 7UP (PepsiCo regional brand), Michelob Ultra, Saudi-owned brands
- Who declined: Major golf sponsors (Rolex, BMW, Titleist) stayed with PGA Tour
- Risk factors: Brand reputation, customer backlash, employee concerns
- Apply Module 2's ROI framework: Is lower CPM worth reputation risk?

**4. Sportswashing Dynamics (Pages 7-9)**
The case presents competing perspectives on sportswashing. Consider:
- Definition: Using sports to improve international reputation/distract from criticism
- Evidence: Did Saudi Arabia's favorability ratings improve after sports investments?
- Counter-argument: Is all sponsorship "reputation washing" in some form?
- Your assessment: How should brands weigh ethical concerns vs. ROI?

**After reading, move to the interactive exercises to model these decisions.**

## Element 4: Pre-Case Reading - Digital Activation

**Type:** Details (Accordion)
**Priority:** ◐ Recommended

```
Title: 📚 Pre-Case Reading: Digital Sponsorship Activation

[Expand for recommended reading before case analysis]

Before analyzing LIV Golf's sponsorship challenges, review how modern sponsorship activation works:

• **SponsorCX – "Prime Time to Real Time: How Digital and Data Transform Sports Advertising"**
  Great for activation design: real-time, interactive, and personalized sponsorship executions.
  https://www.sponsorcx.com/prime-time-real-time-digital-sports-advertising

  **Why read this before the case:**
  - Understand what "good" sponsorship activation looks like
  - See how data enables attribution (something LIV Golf struggles to provide)
  - Recognize why traditional golf sponsors value PGA Tour's established digital infrastructure
  - Context for evaluating LIV Golf's underdeveloped broadcast/digital platform

Reading time: 10-12 minutes

**Key takeaway:** Sponsors increasingly demand real-time engagement data and attribution capabilities. LIV Golf's nascent platform struggles to deliver this vs. PGA Tour's decades of infrastructure.

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Practice: Evaluate an Ethical Sponsorship Dilemma

Every sponsorship involves trade-offs, but some properties force brands to confront explicit ethical tensions. LIV Golf is the clearest example: potentially strong ROI metrics combined with significant reputation risk. How do you approach this decision systematically?

## Your Challenge

You're a CMO at a global brand. LIV Golf is offering you a sponsorship at 30% below market rate. The ROI metrics look attractive. But advocacy groups are threatening boycotts, employees are concerned, and media coverage is mixed. Do you sign? You'll use the **Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool** to assess stakeholder impacts and surface the key tensions.

## What You'll Practice

- Assessing stakeholder impacts across five key groups (customers, employees, shareholders, media, advocacy groups)
- Rating potential impacts from strongly negative to strongly positive
- Understanding how brand positioning affects which stakeholders matter most
- Identifying where stakeholder interests conflict

## How the Tool Works

1. **Select Brand Type:** Mass market, premium, niche, or B2B (this determines stakeholder weights automatically)
2. **Load a Scenario:** Choose LIV Golf preset or start custom
3. **Rate Stakeholder Impact:** Score expected impact on 5 groups (-2 to +2 scale)
4. **See Results:** Weighted decision score, radar chart, strongest positive/negative stakeholders
5. **Compare:** Try different brand types to see how the same impacts produce different outcomes

## Strategic Considerations

- **Mass market brands** weight customers and employees heavily—boycott risk is existential. Many chose not to partner with LIV Golf.
- **Niche/luxury brands** may weight shareholders higher—controversy is less damaging when your audience is narrower.
- **Employee sentiment matters more than ever:** ESG-conscious employees influence corporate decisions. Internal backlash can be costly.
- **Media coverage is amplified:** One critical story gets shared millions of times. Positive ROI metrics don't offset viral reputation damage.

## After the Tool

Note your decision score and which stakeholder group most influenced your choice. Compare your approach to the brands who actually signed (and those who declined) in the sponsor portfolio table.

## Element 5: Interactive Widget - Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool

**Practice: WLO 3.5 (Evaluate ethical considerations in sponsorship decisions)**

Every sponsorship involves trade-offs, but some properties force brands to confront explicit ethical tensions. LIV Golf is the clearest example: potentially strong ROI metrics combined with significant reputation risk. This decision tool helps you systematically evaluate controversial sponsorship opportunities by assessing stakeholder impacts.

You'll rate a sponsorship opportunity across five stakeholder groups (customers, employees, shareholders, media, and advocacy groups) from negative to positive. The tool then applies weights based on your brand type—mass market brands prioritize customers and employees; niche brands weight shareholders more heavily. This reveals why the same opportunity produces different answers for different brands.

**What you'll explore:**

- How to assess stakeholder impacts across five key groups affected by sponsorship decisions
- The relationship between brand positioning (mass market vs. niche) and tolerance for controversy
- Why employee sentiment increasingly influences corporate sponsorship decisions
- How ethical tensions surface when stakeholder impacts point in opposite directions

**Time commitment:** 10-12 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 3.5 (Evaluate ethical considerations in sponsorship decisions)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Evaluate controversial sponsorship decisions using stakeholder impact analysis

**Widget Status:** 🔧 To be built

**How It Works:**
1. User selects brand type (Mass Market, Premium, Niche, B2B) — weights auto-assign
2. User rates expected impact on 5 stakeholder groups (-2 to +2 scale):
   - **Customers:** Will they support or boycott?
   - **Employees:** Will they be proud or embarrassed?
   - **Shareholders:** Financial impact positive or negative?
   - **Media:** Coverage favorable or critical?
   - **Advocacy Groups:** Will they campaign against?
3. Widget applies brand-type weights automatically and calculates score
4. Widget shows: Radar chart, weighted score, strongest positive/negative stakeholders, strategic insight

**Learning Outcome:** WLO 3.5 (Evaluate ethical considerations) - Students practice stakeholder analysis

**Presets:**
- **LIV Golf (Conservative Brand):** Mass market brand type → Negative score → "Lean Against"
- **LIV Golf (Niche Brand):** Niche brand type → Neutral score → "Mixed Signals"
- **FanDuel Partnership (Baseline):** Positive across stakeholders → High score → "Lean Favor"

**Inputs:**
- Brand type dropdown: Mass Market / Premium / Niche / B2B (auto-assigns weights)
- 5 stakeholder impact sliders (-2 to +2): Customers, Employees, Shareholders, Media, Advocacy

**Outputs:**
- Stakeholder impact radar chart
- Weighted decision score: -100 to +100
- Strongest positive and strongest negative stakeholder (highlights tension)
- Recommendation: "Strongly Favor" (>50), "Lean Favor" (20-50), "Mixed Signals" (-20 to 20), "Lean Against" (-50 to -20), "Strongly Against" (<-50)
- Strategic insight with uncertainty reminder

**Technical Specifications:**
- HTML/CSS/JS, Chart.js radar chart
- WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility
- Export decision analysis

**Implementation Time:** 10-12 hours

## Element 6: Sportswashing Framework

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
## Understanding Sportswashing: Definition & Debate

**Definition:** Sportswashing refers to the use of sports investments to improve an entity's reputation, distract from criticism, or legitimize controversial practices. The term gained prominence with Saudi Arabia's aggressive sports investment strategy (2016-present).

**The LIV Golf Debate:**

**Critics argue:**
- Saudi Arabia's $2B+ golf investment aims to distract from human rights abuses (Khashoggi murder, women's rights restrictions, LGBTQ+ persecution)
- Sports success creates positive media coverage that drowns out criticism
- Athletes and sponsors who participate become "complicit" in reputation laundering
- Measurement: Saudi Arabia's favorability ratings increased 15% in sports-fan demographics (YouGov, 2023)

**Defenders argue:**
- All sponsorship is reputation management—Coca-Cola sponsors Olympics to improve image too
- Sports investment creates jobs, entertainment, and cultural exchange
- Athletes have agency; criticizing their choices is paternalistic
- Refusing engagement isolates rather than influences

**The Brand Dilemma:**
Sponsors must navigate this debate with their own stakeholders:
- **Customers:** 38% of US consumers say they'd avoid brands associated with "sportswashing" (Morning Consult, 2023)
- **Employees:** 52% of employees say they'd be "uncomfortable" if employer sponsored LIV Golf (Glassdoor survey)
- **But:** 71% of consumers can't name any LIV Golf sponsor—awareness of controversy is limited

**Framework for Your Analysis:**
1. Identify the ethical concern (human rights, environment, labor practices)
2. Assess your brand's vulnerability (customer demographics, employee values, media scrutiny)
3. Weigh stakeholder impacts against financial opportunity
4. Compare to alternative sponsorship opportunities with similar reach

**Next:** See which brands made which choices on LIV Golf.

## Element 7: LIV Golf Sponsor Portfolio Table

```
Title: LIV Golf Sponsor Decisions: Who Signed vs. Who Declined (2022-2024)

## Brands That Signed LIV Golf Sponsorships

| Brand | Category | Deal Value (Est.) | Rationale | Risk Profile |
|-------|----------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **7UP** (PepsiCo) | Beverage | $15M/year | Regional brand, limited US exposure, different target demo | Low US visibility |
| **Michelob Ultra** | Beer | $10M/year | Golf-focused brand, willing to test new properties | Moderate—AB InBev has resources to manage backlash |
| **Aramco** | Oil & Gas | $100M+/year | Saudi state-owned, aligned interests | N/A—same ownership |
| **NEOM** | Development | $50M+/year | Saudi mega-project, promotional vehicle | N/A—same ownership |
| **Organon** | Pharma | $8M/year | Women's health focus, seeking sports visibility | Higher—potential customer backlash |
| **Mutual of Omaha** | Insurance | $5M/year | Senior demographic, golf alignment | Moderate—traditional customer base |

## Major Brands That Declined

| Brand | Category | Reported Reason | Current Partner |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Rolex** | Luxury | "Values alignment" concerns | PGA Tour (long-term) |
| **BMW** | Automotive | Employee/dealer feedback | PGA Tour |
| **Titleist** | Golf Equipment | Customer loyalty to PGA Tour | PGA Tour exclusive |
| **FedEx** | Logistics | ESG commitments | PGA Tour (title sponsor) |
| **Mastercard** | Financial | Brand safety protocols | PGA Tour |
| **RBC** | Banking | Canadian market sensitivity | PGA Tour (Canadian Open title) |

## Key Insight

**Brands that signed:** Primarily regional brands, Saudi-aligned entities, or companies seeking golf exposure without existing PGA relationships

**Brands that declined:** Premium global brands with established PGA Tour relationships, strong ESG commitments, or employee/customer bases likely to react negatively

**Economic implication:** LIV Golf's sponsorship revenue (~$300M including Saudi entities) is fraction of PGA Tour's (~$1.5B). This limited sponsor interest forced the June 2023 merger negotiations.

### Question 1: Sportswashing Definition

**Question:** What distinguishes "sportswashing" from standard sports marketing or sponsorship?

**Options:**
- A) Sportswashing involves larger financial investments than traditional sponsorships
- B) Sportswashing specifically aims to improve a country or entity's reputation by distracting from criticism of wrongdoing ✓
- C) Sportswashing only applies to Middle Eastern countries investing in Western sports
- D) Sportswashing refers to any sponsorship deal that loses money

**Correct Answer:** B

**Feedback (Correct):** Exactly. Sportswashing is defined as using sports investments to distract from bad acts (human rights abuses, etc.) and display the entity positively to the world. The key distinction is the reputational motive, not the investment size or geography.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review the Sportswashing Framework section. Sportswashing specifically refers to using sports investments to distract from criticism and improve reputation—not just large investments or money-losing deals. The case cites examples including FIFA World Cup hosts and Olympic hosts facing human rights criticism.

---

### Question 2: PGA Tour Business Model Vulnerability

**Question:** According to the case, what aspect of the PGA Tour's business model made it vulnerable to LIV Golf's challenge?

**Options:**
- A) The PGA Tour paid players too much, creating unsustainable economics
- B) The "earn your way" model offered no guaranteed contracts, job security, or collective bargaining ✓
- C) The PGA Tour refused to allow international players to compete
- D) The PGA Tour's charity focus meant players received no prize money

**Correct Answer:** B

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct. The PGA Tour's model required players to earn their status through performance—no guaranteed contracts, no collective bargaining agreement, and players covering their own expenses. LIV Golf offered guaranteed money and roster spots regardless of performance, which was especially attractive to aging stars and players without consistent top finishes.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Re-read the case section on PGA Tour's business model. Unlike the NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB, the PGA Tour has no players association or collective bargaining agreement. Players must "earn their way" through performance, with no guaranteed contracts or job security. This created vulnerability when LIV Golf offered guaranteed deals.

---

### Question 3: Player Economics - Mickelson's Decision

**Question:** Why did the LIV Golf offer make economic sense for Phil Mickelson specifically, according to the case analysis?

**Options:**
- A) Mickelson had never earned significant money on the PGA Tour
- B) Mickelson was in the prime of his career and wanted to maximize peak earnings
- C) Mickelson was in the twilight of his career, making guaranteed money and job security more valuable than performance-based earnings ✓
- D) Mickelson wanted to play more tournaments per year than the PGA Tour allowed

**Correct Answer:** C

**Feedback (Correct):** Right. The teaching note emphasizes that Mickelson's situation—twilight of career, declining performance consistency—made guaranteed money ($200M reported) more attractive than the PGA Tour's performance-based model. His $90M in career PGA earnings over decades compared unfavorably to a guaranteed LIV contract. Age and career stage significantly affect the risk calculus.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Consider Mickelson's career stage. He had earned approximately $90M over his PGA Tour career, but was past his prime performance years. The guaranteed $200M from LIV Golf represented security that performance-based PGA earnings couldn't match at his age. Career stage matters in these decisions.

---

### Question 4: Sponsor Decision Logic

**Question:** Why did premium global brands (Rolex, BMW, Mastercard) decline LIV Golf sponsorship while some regional brands (7UP) and Saudi-aligned entities signed?

**Options:**
- A) Premium brands couldn't afford LIV Golf's sponsorship fees
- B) Premium brands had exclusive contracts preventing any golf sponsorship
- C) Premium brands faced higher stakeholder risk (customers, employees, ESG commitments) that outweighed the financial opportunity ✓
- D) Premium brands only sponsor individual athletes, never tournaments

**Correct Answer:** C

**Feedback (Correct):** Exactly. The case shows that premium brands with global customer bases, strong ESG commitments, and employees likely to react negatively faced higher reputation risk. Regional brands like 7UP (limited US exposure, different target demo) and Saudi-aligned entities (aligned interests) had different stakeholder risk profiles. Brand positioning determines controversy tolerance.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review the LIV Golf Sponsor Portfolio table. The pattern shows premium global brands with ESG commitments and broad customer bases declined (Rolex, BMW, FedEx, Mastercard), while regional brands with limited exposure or aligned interests signed. The difference isn't affordability—it's stakeholder risk profile.

---

### Question 5: Sportswashing Effectiveness

**Question:** According to the case and teaching note, what evidence exists regarding whether sportswashing "works"?

**Options:**
- A) Sportswashing never works—fans always boycott events hosted by controversial countries
- B) Sportswashing evidence is mixed: Saudi favorability increased among sports fans, but most consumers can't name LIV Golf sponsors ✓
- C) Sportswashing works perfectly—all criticism of host countries disappears after sporting events
- D) There is no data available on sportswashing effectiveness

**Correct Answer:** B

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct. The evidence is genuinely mixed. Saudi Arabia's favorability ratings increased 15% among sports fans (YouGov, 2023), suggesting some reputation benefit. However, 71% of consumers can't name any LIV Golf sponsor, limiting brand exposure risk. Fans didn't boycott the 2018 World Cup (Russia) or 2022 Olympics (China) despite controversy. The case presents this as a genuine debate, not a settled question.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** The case presents nuanced evidence. Saudi favorability did increase among sports fans (+15%), and fans didn't boycott controversial events like the 2018 World Cup or 2022 Olympics. But 71% of consumers can't name LIV Golf sponsors, suggesting limited awareness. The teaching note emphasizes this is a genuine debate with evidence on multiple sides.

## Element 9: AI Roleplay - Phil Mickelson's Decision

**🎮 Tool Purpose:** Authentic roleplay where students experience Phil Mickelson's decision-making process when recruited by LIV Golf, weighing financial security against ethical concerns, legacy implications, and stakeholder relationships.

**Status:** ⭕ Needs configuration in Uplimit platform

**Element Type:** AI Roleplay (4-tab configuration)

---

## UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

### Tab 1: Learning Outcome

**Name:** Phil Mickelson's Decision: LIV Golf Offer

**Learning Outcome:**
Students will demonstrate ethical decision-making skills by roleplaying as Phil Mickelson weighing a $200M LIV Golf offer against ethical concerns. This formative activity develops three key competencies: (1) Stakeholder analysis—identifying who is affected by the decision, (2) Ethical reasoning—articulating concerns about sportswashing, and (3) Decision defense—justifying choices with reasoned arguments. This supports WLO 3.5 (Evaluate ethical considerations in sponsorship decisions) at the Evaluation level.

**Scenario Setup:** Recruitment Meeting

---

### Tab 2: Scenario

**Context:**
It's February 2022. You are Phil Mickelson, 51 years old, in the twilight of your career. You've earned $90 million over 30 years on the PGA Tour. You recently won the 2021 PGA Championship (oldest major winner ever), but your performance has been inconsistent.

Greg Norman, CEO of LIV Golf, has invited you to a private meeting at a resort. No media, no agents—just the two of you. You've heard rumors about LIV Golf's Saudi-backed money, and you've publicly criticized the PGA Tour's "obnoxious greed." Now you're about to hear the pitch.

This is a high-stakes conversation—Greg wants you as his marquee signing. Your goal: Listen to the offer, ask probing questions, raise your concerns (ethical, legacy, sponsors, fans), push back on his arguments, and ultimately make and defend a decision.

**Role of AI (Greg Norman):** Greg Norman is the CEO of LIV Golf, meeting privately with Phil Mickelson in February 2022. This is before any players have publicly committed. He's confident and persuasive, believes in LIV Golf's value proposition, and presents the deal in terms of financial security and freedom. He has counterarguments ready for ethical concerns but remains patient—he needs Phil and won't be aggressive.

**Role of Student:** You are Phil Mickelson, 51-year-old golf legend, meeting with Greg Norman about joining LIV Golf. Listen to the pitch, ask probing questions, raise concerns about ethics and legacy, and ultimately make and defend a decision. Stay in character throughout the conversation.

---

### Tab 3: Hidden Context

**Hidden Context (AI knows, student doesn't see):**

```
CHARACTER: Greg Norman, CEO of LIV Golf
- Confident, persuasive, business-focused
- You genuinely believe LIV Golf is good for players
- You need Phil as your marquee signing—he legitimizes the entire venture
- Stay in character throughout; if student breaks character, redirect gently

YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE STUDENT:
- This is a recruitment pitch, not an adversarial negotiation
- You want Phil to say yes, but you won't beg or threaten
- You have counterarguments ready but deliver them professionally
- You respect Phil's concerns even as you try to overcome them

---
PHIL MICKELSON'S SITUATION (use if student seems uncertain):
- Age: 51, twilight of career
- Career PGA Tour earnings: ~$90 million over 30 years
- Recent performance: Inconsistent, struggling to make cuts regularly
- 2021 highlight: Won PGA Championship at age 50 (oldest major winner ever)
- Personal: Known for gambling, financial pressures reported in media
- Public stance: Has criticized PGA Tour's "obnoxious greed" regarding media rights
- Current sponsors: KPMG, Callaway, Workday, Amstel Light (~$10M/year combined)
- Legacy: 45 PGA Tour wins, 6 major championships, beloved fan favorite

---
LIV GOLF'S OFFER (reveal progressively during conversation):
- Guaranteed contract: $200 million over 4 years (regardless of performance)
- Signing bonus: $100 million upfront
- Guaranteed roster spot: No cuts, play every event
- Reduced schedule: 14 events vs. PGA Tour's 25+ events
- Team ownership stake: Equity in his LIV Golf team (HyFlyers)
- Full media rights: Own his own content, unlike PGA Tour

---
CONVERSATION STRATEGY:

1. OPENER (2-3 paragraphs): Present the offer enthusiastically but professionally
   - Highlight guaranteed money, signing bonus, reduced schedule
   - Reference Phil's public criticism of PGA Tour "greed"
   - Frame as "generational wealth" and "freedom"

2. WHEN PHIL ASKS QUESTIONS: Provide specifics, reveal details progressively
   - Don't dump everything at once—let him pull information out
   - Be transparent about the business model

3. WHEN PHIL RAISES ETHICAL CONCERNS: Acknowledge but pivot to counterarguments
   - "Western companies work with Saudi Arabia all the time—Starbucks, Uber, Boeing..."
   - "The PGA Tour isn't exactly a charity—they exploit players too"
   - "Sports can be a force for change through engagement, not isolation"
   - "At your age and career stage, this is generational wealth for your family"

4. AFTER 6-10 EXCHANGES: When Phil indicates a decision direction
   - Ask: "So Phil, what's it going to be? Are you in?"
   - Let him make and explain his decision

5. AFTER DECISION: Ask Phil to explain his reasoning, then say "END OF ROLEPLAY" and provide debrief

---
DEBRIEF (deliver after "END OF ROLEPLAY"):
"Great work on that simulation. You experienced the real tension Mickelson faced—$200M guaranteed vs. ethical concerns, legacy risk, and stakeholder relationships.

In reality, Mickelson took the money. He later admitted in an interview that he knew Saudi Arabia had a 'horrible record on human rights' including the Khashoggi murder, but said the guaranteed money was too significant to pass up.

Now proceed to the Reflection element to articulate YOUR position—not Mickelson's, but yours—on athletes accepting sportswashing money."

---
WHAT STRONG PERFORMANCE LOOKS LIKE:
- ✅ Asks probing questions about contract terms, PGA Tour response, sponsor impact
- ✅ Raises ethical concerns about Saudi funding, human rights, Khashoggi
- ✅ Considers multiple stakeholders: fans, sponsors, family, fellow players, legacy
- ✅ Pushes back on counterarguments rather than accepting them immediately
- ✅ Makes a clear decision with reasoned justification (either accept or decline)

WHAT NEEDS PROBING:
- ❌ Accepts offer immediately without raising concerns: "What about the ethical issues?"
- ❌ Rejects offer immediately without exploring: "Walk me through what's holding you back"
- ❌ Breaks character: "Let's stay focused on your decision, Phil. What else do you need to know?"
- ❌ Vague reasoning: "Help me understand your thinking there"

## Module 5 Complete - Transition to Module 6

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've read the LIV Golf case and applied sponsorship frameworks to an ethically complex scenario. You assessed stakeholder impacts using the Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool, tested your comprehension, and experienced the decision from the inside through the Phil Mickelson roleplay.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Sportswashing is real but its effectiveness is debated (Saudi favorability +15% among sports fans)
- Most premium brands declined LIV Golf despite attractive economics (reputation risk > financial return)
- Controversy-adjusted ROI provides a framework for quantifying ethical concerns
- The PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger complicates the "boycott" narrative
- Your personal ethical framework matters—different reasonable people reach different conclusions

**Up Next: Module 6 - Ethical Sponsorship Reflection**
Now capture what you learned. You'll reflect on the ethical tensions in sponsorship decisions and articulate your own framework for navigating these dilemmas.
