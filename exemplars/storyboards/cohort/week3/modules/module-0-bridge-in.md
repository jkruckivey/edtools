**VTT File:** `week3-bridge-scenario.vtt` (required for accessibility)
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation

### Video Script: "The $500 Million Question" (SME Direct-to-Camera)

**Recording Setup:** SME on camera, professional background, teleprompter optional

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years on the brand side of sports marketing—
negotiating sponsorships, building activations, and trying to justify why we pay
millions of dollars to put our logo on a jersey.

And I want to start Week 3 with a question that haunts every CMO I know."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $500 Million Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "Major brands like Nike spend hundreds of millions annually on sports sponsorships worldwide.
Every league, every athlete, every major property you can think of.

[VISUAL CUE: Show montage of Nike-sponsored properties]

Your CFO looks at this budget and asks the obvious question:
'What are we getting for all these sponsorship dollars?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Billions spent on sponsorship"]

So you show them the metrics:
• 15 billion social media impressions
• 3.2 billion TV viewers reached
• 500 million jersey sales (swoosh visibility)

[Pause, lean forward]

And your CFO says: 'That's nice. But did we SELL more shoes?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "But did it drive sales?"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's the uncomfortable truth: Most brands can't definitively prove sponsorship ROI.

Nike BELIEVES their sports partnerships drive billions in sales. They have mountains
of correlation data. But causation? That's where it gets messy.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Correlation ≠ Causation"]

Because here's what makes sports sponsorship different from digital advertising:

Digital ad: You click, you buy, we track it. ROI = crystal clear.

Sports sponsorship: You see the swoosh on LeBron's jersey during Game 7. Three months
later, you buy new running shoes. Was that BECAUSE of the sponsorship? Or would you
have bought them anyway?

This isn't unique to Nike. It's THE challenge facing every brand spending billions
on sports partnerships.


[1:50-2:30] THE CHALLENGE

SME: "This week, you're going to learn how brands ACTUALLY measure sponsorship value—
even when perfect attribution is impossible. You'll understand why sports betting
has become the fastest-growing sponsorship category (hint: it's the ONLY category
with perfect attribution). And you'll build a 1-page activation plan with ROI
projections that could actually get approved by a skeptical CFO.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "How do you prove $500M is working?"]

But here's the meta-lesson: The brands that win in sports marketing aren't the ones
with perfect data. They're the ones who build FRAMEWORKS that quantify value even
when data is messy.

That's what you'll learn this week. But first, I need to know: Can you calculate
sponsorship ROI RIGHT NOW—with imperfect data?

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Can you calculate ROI with messy data?"]

The next exercise is a diagnostic conversation. It'll reveal whether you understand
how brands justify multi-million dollar sports partnerships. Not graded—just revealing.

Ready? Let's see what you know about sponsorship economics."

## Element 2: AI Roleplay - Sponsorship ROI Diagnostic

**Widget Type:** AI Roleplay (Uplimit built-in element)
**Purpose:** Diagnostic conversation revealing knowledge gaps about sponsorship ROI calculation (formative, not graded)
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 minutes
**Learning Outcome Supported:** Prepares for WLO 3.3 (calculate sponsorship ROI) and WLO 3.4 (design activations)

### Student-Facing Instructions (Place as Text element BEFORE AI Roleplay)

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **sponsorship consultant** hired by a major consumer brand. The CMO (AI) needs to justify $50M in annual sports sponsorships to their skeptical CFO.

### Getting Started
**You need to start the conversation.** When the chat opens, begin by explaining (in simple terms) how you think brands should measure sponsorship ROI when direct "click-to-purchase" attribution isn't available.

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to ace this!** Most students struggle before learning Week 3 content. The goal is to discover gaps in your understanding so you know what to focus on this week.

### Conversation Length
3-4 exchanges with the CMO. If you get stuck, that's the point—those are your learning priorities.
```

### UPLIFT CONFIGURATION

**Tab 1: Learning Outcome**

**Widget Name:** Sponsorship ROI Diagnostic

**Learning Outcome:**
```
Students will articulate their current understanding of how brands calculate sponsorship ROI with imperfect attribution data, revealing knowledge gaps before learning Week 3 frameworks. This diagnostic conversation helps students identify three key areas:

1. CPM calculation knowledge (can they convert impressions to dollar values?)
2. Attribution challenges (do they understand why sponsorship ROI differs from digital advertising?)
3. Activation multipliers (are they aware of the 2-3× activation spend rule?)

Success = Student finishes knowing exactly what they DON'T know yet, with motivation to learn Week 3 content.
```

**Scenario Setup:** Diagnostic (pre-learning assessment)

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

**Context:**
```
A major consumer brand (apparel, beverage, or automotive) spends $50 million per year on sports sponsorships. The CFO is skeptical and demands ROI proof before approving next year's budget. The brand's CMO has hired a sponsorship consultant to build a framework for measuring sponsorship value when direct "click-to-purchase" attribution isn't possible. The learner will engage in a diagnostic conversation with the CMO who asks probing Socratic questions to help reveal the learner's current understanding of sponsorship ROI while gently exposing gaps in their knowledge. This formative exercise helps the learner identify what they need to focus on during Week 3.
```

**Role of AI (CMO):**
```
The AI plays the CMO of a major consumer brand who needs to justify $50M in sports sponsorships to a skeptical CFO and is seeking the consultant's help to build a measurement framework.
```

**Role of Student:**
```
The learner plays the role of a sponsorship consultant advising the CMO on how to calculate ROI when direct attribution is challenging.
```

---

**Tab 3: Hidden Context**

```
**AI Character Context:**
You are a CMO conducting a diagnostic conversation. The student is encountering sponsorship ROI frameworks for the first time. Most will struggle—this is intentional and pedagogically valuable.

**What Students Typically Miss (use to guide probing):**
- CPM calculation (Cost Per Mille = rights fee / impressions × 1,000)
- The 2-3× activation rule (for every $1 in rights, spend $2-3 on activation)
- Attribution differences (sponsorship vs. digital advertising)
- Betting sponsor advantages (closed-loop attribution, first-party data)
- Brand value vs. sales conversion (awareness ≠ revenue)

**AI Personality Traits:**
- Professional but empathetic: You acknowledge ROI is genuinely hard to measure
- Socratic: When they struggle, you ask questions that help them discover gaps rather than lecturing
- Patient: This is diagnostic, so you don't expect perfection
- Business-focused: You care about clear explanations backed by strategic reasoning

**Conversation Strategy:**

Wait for the student to start the conversation. They've been asked to explain how to measure sponsorship ROI. Listen to their opening explanation, then respond with probing questions based on what they say:

1. If they mention only impressions/awareness, ask: "We get 500 million impressions from our jersey sponsor. What's that worth in dollars? What's the formula?"

2. If they struggle with CPM, ask: "How is sponsorship ROI different from digital advertising ROI where we can track clicks to purchases?"

3. If they don't mention activation, ask: "So if we pay $5M for a sponsorship, is that our total investment? What else should we budget for?"

4. If they mention betting sponsors, ask: "You mentioned betting sponsors have better data. What's 'closed-loop attribution' and why can't traditional sponsors do that?"

5. Closing (after 3-4 exchanges): Acknowledge their effort and gaps: "You've got some intuitions about brand value, but there are industry frameworks—like CPM, engagement multipliers, and conversion attribution—that would sharpen your thinking. That's exactly what you'll learn this week."

Exit gracefully after 3-4 exchanges even if they're still struggling—the goal is diagnosis, not mastery.

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Student attempts answer (even if incomplete)
- ✅ Student recognizes their knowledge gaps
- ✅ Student feels motivated to learn, not defeated
```

---

**Tab 4: Criteria**

**Grading:** Not graded (formative diagnostic - completion credit only)

No evaluation criteria. Students receive completion credit for engaging with the AI roleplay. This diagnostic is designed to reveal knowledge gaps before learning begins, not to assess mastery.

## Element 3: Infobox - The Sponsorship Problem Statement

**Type:** Infobox (Callout variant)
**Icon:** ⚠️ or 💡
**Priority:** ⬤ Required

```
Title: ⚠️ The Sponsorship ROI Challenge

Major brands like Nike spend hundreds of millions annually on sports sponsorships worldwide. They can track
billions of impressions and millions of jersey sales. But when their CFO asks,
"Did this drive shoe sales?"—the answer gets complicated.

**The Strategic Challenge:**

Unlike digital advertising (click → purchase → perfect attribution), sports sponsorship
value is distributed across awareness, consideration, purchase intent, and long-term
brand equity. You see LeBron's Nike jersey in June. You buy new shoes in September.
Was that BECAUSE of the sponsorship? Or correlation without causation?

**This Week's Question:**

How do you calculate ROI for sports partnerships when perfect attribution is impossible—
but billion-dollar budgets require justification?

You'll learn the frameworks brands use to quantify sponsorship value: CPM analysis,
engagement multipliers, conversion attribution, and closed-loop measurement (the sports
betting innovation). You'll build activation plans with ROI projections that CFOs
actually approve.

**But first**: The diagnostic exercises below reveal what you understand NOW about
sponsorship ROI—before you learn Week 3's frameworks. This helps you identify exactly
where to focus your learning energy this week.

### Challenge 1: Prove Sponsorship Value

**The Problem:** A CFO asks: "We spend $50M on sports sponsorships. What are we getting for it?" Can you explain why proving sponsorship ROI is fundamentally harder than proving digital advertising ROI?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Why attribution is difficult (time lag, multiple touchpoints)
- How sponsorship compares to other revenue streams
- Basic measurement concepts (CPM, impressions)

**Test yourself:** Can you explain why Nike struggles to prove their $500M+ sponsorship investment works?
```

## Element 4C: MC Question 1 - Attribution Challenge `[v3.2.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
Nike pays $500M+/year in sports sponsorships worldwide. Why can't they easily prove ROI to their CFO?
```

**Options:**

```
They don't track impressions or media value
```

```
Sports sponsorships don't actually drive sales
```

```
Attribution is difficult—consumers see sponsorships but buy products months later ✅
```

```
CFOs don't understand marketing metrics
```

**After Submission:**
```
The attribution gap is the fundamental challenge of sponsorship measurement. Unlike digital ads (click → purchase → track), sponsorship value is distributed across time and touchpoints.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! You see LeBron's Nike jersey in June. You buy shoes in September. Was that BECAUSE of the sponsorship? This time lag makes ROI proof extremely difficult.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Nike tracks billions of impressions. The challenge isn't data collection—it's connecting those impressions to actual purchases when there's a months-long gap between exposure and buying.
```

## Element 4D: MC Question 2 - Sponsorship Scale `[v3.2.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
Which revenue stream is typically LARGER for most professional sports leagues?
```

**Options:**

```
Sponsorship and partnership revenue ✅
```

```
Ticketing and live event revenue
```

```
Merchandise and licensing revenue
```

```
Concessions and hospitality revenue
```

**After Submission:**
```
Sponsorship has grown to exceed ticketing for most major leagues, making it the "financial backbone" of professional sports—even though fans often think tickets drive most revenue.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Sponsorship typically generates 15-25% of revenue, often exceeding ticketing (especially post-pandemic). Understanding this scale is critical for sports business strategy.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
While ticketing feels most visible to fans, sponsorship has grown substantially. For many leagues, corporate partnerships now exceed gate receipts as a revenue source.

### Challenge 2: Calculate ROI

**The Problem:** A brand VP asks: "I paid $10M for this sponsorship. Was it worth it?" Can you use industry frameworks to quantify sponsorship value?

**What you'll need to know:**
- CPM (Cost Per Mille) calculation and benchmarks
- The reach × engagement × conversion formula
- How to calculate actual ROI percentage

**Test yourself:** Can you calculate whether a $10M sponsorship generating 500M impressions is a good deal?
```

## Element 4F: MC Question 3 - CPM Basics `[v3.2.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
What does "CPM" mean in sponsorship measurement?
```

**Options:**

```
Cost Per Match (price per game sponsored)
```

```
Corporate Partnership Model
```

```
Customer Purchase Metric
```

```
Cost Per Mille (cost per thousand impressions) ✅
```

**After Submission:**
```
CPM (Cost Per Mille) is the foundational metric for valuing media exposure. "Mille" = thousand in Latin. A $20 CPM means paying $20 for every 1,000 impressions.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! CPM lets you compare sponsorship value across different properties. If a jersey sponsor pays $10M for 500M impressions, that's a $20 CPM ($10M ÷ 500,000 thousands).
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
CPM stands for "Cost Per Mille" (mille = thousand in Latin). It measures cost per 1,000 impressions and is the standard metric for comparing media value across platforms.

## Element 4G: MC Question 4 - ROI Calculation `[v3.2.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
A brand's sponsorship generates:
- 100M impressions
- 5% engagement rate (5M engaged fans)
- $25M in attributed sales

If they paid $10M for the sponsorship, what's the ROI?
```

**Options:**

```
50% ($5M profit ÷ $10M cost)
```

```
150% ($15M profit ÷ $10M cost) ✅
```

```
250% ($25M revenue ÷ $10M cost)
```

```
ROI cannot be calculated from this data
```

**After Submission:**
```
ROI = (Revenue - Cost) ÷ Cost × 100. With $25M revenue and $10M cost, profit is $15M. ROI = $15M ÷ $10M = 150%.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Perfect calculation! ROI = (Revenue - Cost) ÷ Cost. ($25M - $10M) ÷ $10M = 150%. This sponsorship returned $1.50 for every $1 invested.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Remember: ROI = (Revenue - Cost) ÷ Cost × 100. First subtract the cost from revenue to get profit ($25M - $10M = $15M), then divide by cost ($15M ÷ $10M = 150%).

### Challenge 3: Evaluate Betting Economics

**The Problem:** A league commissioner asks: "Why are betting companies suddenly our biggest sponsors?" Can you explain what makes betting partnerships different from traditional categories?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Why betting is the fastest-growing sponsorship category
- What "closed-loop attribution" means
- How betting differs from beer, automotive, and other traditional sponsors

**Test yourself:** Can you explain why FanDuel can prove ROI but Budweiser can't?
```

## Element 4I: MC Question 5 - Betting Growth Driver `[v3.2.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
Why is sports betting the fastest-growing sponsorship category?
```

**Options:**

```
Betting companies have larger marketing budgets than traditional sponsors
```

```
All sports fans want to gamble on games they watch
```

```
Traditional sponsors are abandoning sports partnerships
```

```
It offers closed-loop attribution—every bet can be tracked directly to the sponsor ✅
```

**After Submission:**
```
Closed-loop attribution solves sponsorship's biggest problem: proving ROI. When a fan sees a FanDuel ad and places a bet, every dollar can be tracked directly to that sponsorship.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! FanDuel knows: "This fan saw our courtside sign, downloaded our app, and bet $500 this month." No other sponsor category can track the full journey from impression to purchase.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
The key differentiator is attribution. Betting sponsors can track every customer from ad impression to app download to actual bets placed—something beer and auto sponsors can't do.

**Question:**
```
What makes betting sponsorships unique compared to traditional categories like beer or automotive?
```

**Options:**

```
Betting offers immediate attribution—fan sees ad, places bet, sponsor tracks conversion ✅
```

```
Betting sponsors pay significantly more money per deal
```

```
Betting is legal in all 50 US states now
```

```
Traditional sponsors no longer see value in sports partnerships
```

**After Submission:**
```
The fundamental difference is attribution speed and precision. Betting creates an immediate, trackable action that traditional sponsors can't replicate.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! When you see a Budweiser ad, you might buy beer next week at a grocery store—untraceable. When you see a FanDuel ad, you might bet immediately on your phone—every dollar tracked.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
While betting sponsors do pay well, the key advantage is attribution. Traditional sponsors can't connect their courtside sign to a beer purchase at Walmart. Betting sponsors can track every bet.

When fans purchase products from the sponsor
```

```
Marketing activities that bring the partnership to life beyond logo placement ✅
```

```
The press release announcing the sponsorship deal
```

**After Submission:**
```
Activation is everything a brand does to leverage their sponsorship beyond the basic logo exposure. The best sponsors spend 2-3× their rights fee on activation.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Activation includes fan experiences, social campaigns, retail promotions, athlete appearances, and branded content. Industry rule: spend $2-3 on activation for every $1 on rights.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Activation happens AFTER signing the deal. It's the marketing activities—fan zones, social campaigns, athlete partnerships, retail promotions—that make the sponsorship actually work.

**Question:**
```
A brand sponsors an NBA team for $8M/year. They calculate:
- Reach: 50M fans exposed to brand
- Engagement: 3% interact with brand content (1.5M fans)
- Conversion: 2% of engaged fans purchase ($100 average order)

What's the estimated revenue impact?
```

**Options:**

```
$1.5M (reach × engagement rate)
```

```
Cannot be calculated without more data
```

```
$3M (50M × 3% × $2 per fan)
```

```
$3M (1.5M engaged × 2% × $100) ✅
```

**After Submission:**
```
The reach → engagement → conversion funnel: 50M reach × 3% = 1.5M engaged. 1.5M × 2% conversion = 30,000 purchases. 30,000 × $100 = $3M revenue.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Perfect! You followed the funnel correctly. With $3M revenue on $8M cost, ROI is negative—which is why activation matters. Strong activations improve engagement and conversion rates.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Follow the funnel: Start with reach (50M), apply engagement rate (3% = 1.5M engaged fans), apply conversion rate (2% = 30,000 buyers), multiply by average order ($100) = $3M.

**Widget Name:** Pre-Assessment Results Coach

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a supportive learning coach helping MBA students interpret their pre-assessment results for Week 3 of a sports business course. Students just completed an 8-question diagnostic quiz covering four learning outcomes:

**WLO 3.1 - Sponsorship Economics:** Why sponsorship exceeds ticketing, the attribution challenge, why Nike can't easily prove ROI
**WLO 3.2 - Betting as Growth Driver:** Closed-loop attribution, why betting is fastest-growing category, how betting differs from traditional sponsors
**WLO 3.3 - ROI Calculation:** CPM basics, reach × engagement × conversion formula, calculating actual ROI percentage
**WLO 3.4 - Activation Design:** What activation means, the 2-3× spending rule, designing activations that prove ROI

**Your role:**
1. Ask students how many questions they answered correctly (0-8)
2. Provide personalized guidance based on their score:
   - **0-2/8:** "You're starting fresh—perfect! This week's content will build strong foundations. Focus on Module 2's sponsorship frameworks and take time with each ROI calculator."
   - **3-4/8:** "Solid baseline—you have some pieces of the puzzle. This week will help you connect sponsorship economics to ROI measurement. Pay special attention to the activation tools in Module 4."
   - **5-6/8:** "Strong foundation! You're ready to dive deep into applications. Challenge yourself with the LIV Golf case analysis and Sponsorship Activation Builder."
   - **7-8/8:** "Excellent! You already understand core concepts. This week, focus on nuanced applications—how betting changes sponsorship dynamics, why activation spending matters more than rights fees."
3. If they ask about specific questions, provide brief clarifications using the WLO concepts above
4. Encourage them that pre-assessments reveal learning opportunities, not deficiencies
5. Direct them to Module 1 (Executive Perspectives) after discussion

**Tone:** Supportive, encouraging, concrete (use specific examples), MBA-level (business-focused not academic)

**Do NOT:**
- Provide quiz answers directly (if they ask, say "The quiz helps you self-diagnose, but I can discuss concepts")
- Overwhelm them with too much content (keep responses 2-3 sentences)
- Make them feel bad about low scores (frame as opportunities)
```

Title: 💡 Understanding Your Pre-Assessment Results

Your quiz results create a personalized learning path for this week. Lower scores (0-3/8) suggest spending extra time with Module 2's sponsorship frameworks and Module 3's betting economics—you're building fresh ROI calculation skills, which is perfect for developing rigorous financial analysis. Higher scores (5-8/8) indicate solid marketing intuitions, so challenge yourself with the LIV Golf case analysis and the strategy memo assignment.

Remember: This quiz isn't graded, it's a diagnostic tool to help you learn efficiently and identify where to focus your energy. Now that you know where you stand, let's learn the frameworks that will transform how you calculate and justify sponsorship investments.

**"The New Revenue Frontier: Inside Sports Betting's Transformation"**

May 14, 2018: The Supreme Court strikes down PASPA, opening the door to legal sports betting across America. Follow three partnership executives—at a major league, a sports network, and a casino operator—as they navigate the first 100 days after legalization. Each faces the same challenge: convince skeptical leadership that betting partnerships are worth the brand risk, then build activation frameworks that prove ROI.

**Why read this?** The story introduces the five sponsorship activations you'll analyze this week: Stadium Integration, Broadcast Partnership, Mobile Engagement, Data Licensing, and Responsible Gaming. You'll use these frameworks to evaluate real betting partnerships and calculate sponsorship ROI.
