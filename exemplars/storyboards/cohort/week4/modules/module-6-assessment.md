## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
## What Did You Learn?

You've explored athlete brand strategy through Serena Williams' case—watching how she transformed from endorser to investor, athlete to founder, individual to platform. You tested her strategy against alternatives using the Portfolio Analyzer.

Now capture what you learned. This isn't about getting the "right answer"—it's about showing you understand how elite athletes build wealth beyond their playing careers.

Title: ▪ Assessment: Athlete Brand Strategy Reflection (25 points)

**Your Task:** In 300 words or less, reflect on what you learned about athlete brand strategy from the Serena Williams case.

**Your reflection should address:**

1. **The Strategic Shift** - What distinguishes Serena's approach from typical athletes? Why does equity beat fees?
2. **The Timing Question** - Why did building businesses DURING her playing career matter?
3. **Your Application** - If you were advising a 25-year-old elite athlete, what's the ONE strategic decision from Serena's playbook you'd prioritize—and why?

**Grading (25 points):**
- Strategic shift understanding (10 pts)
- Timing/sequencing insight (8 pts)
- Application with reasoning (7 pts)

**Tip:** Be specific. "Build owned businesses" is vague. "Launch an equity-based venture by age 28 while brand value is highest, because endorsement income disappears at retirement but equity compounds" shows framework thinking.
```

## Element 3: Text Response - Athlete Brand Strategy Reflection

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise → Text Response Question**
2. Configure the following fields:

**Question:**
```
What did you learn about athlete brand strategy from the Serena Williams case? Reflect in 300 words or less.
```

**Additional Instructions:**
```
Your response will be evaluated on:

**Strategic Shift Understanding (10 pts)**
- Explains the difference between fee-based income (endorsements) and equity-based wealth (owned businesses, investments)
- References Serena's ~30/70 allocation strategy
- Shows understanding of why equity compounds while fees don't

**Timing/Sequencing Insight (8 pts)**
- Explains why Serena built businesses DURING her playing career (not after)
- References the career timeline (Serena Ventures 2014, S by Serena 2018)
- Shows understanding of brand value decay post-retirement

**Application with Reasoning (7 pts)**
- Identifies ONE specific strategic decision to prioritize
- Explains WHY this decision matters most
- Shows strategic reasoning, not just opinion

**Reference the Module 5 content:**
- The video's three strategic pivots
- The Portfolio Analyzer results
- Serena's modeled allocation choices
```

**AI Feedback Prompt:**
```
Evaluate this athlete brand strategy reflection. Check for:
1. Did they explain the equity vs. fees distinction (not just that Serena had businesses)?
2. Did they reference timing/sequencing (building during career, not after)?
3. Did they prioritize ONE specific strategic decision with reasoning (not a list)?

Provide brief, encouraging feedback. If their analysis is vague, ask for specific numbers or examples from the Serena case.
```

**Rubric Configuration:**

---

**CRITERION 1: Strategic Shift Understanding**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Describes what Serena did without explaining WHY it matters strategically. No distinction between fee-based and equity-based wealth.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Shows some understanding of equity vs. fees but doesn't fully develop it. May mention "owned businesses" without explaining the compounding advantage.

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Clearly articulates the strategic shift: "Most athletes optimize for endorsement fees (guaranteed but finite), while Serena allocated ~70% to equity-based assets (owned businesses, investments) that compound over time." References the Portfolio Analyzer comparison.

---

**CRITERION 2: Timing/Sequencing Insight**

**Points:** 8

**Does not meet expectations (0-2 pts):**
No mention of timing. Treats Serena's strategy as something that happened without explaining WHEN it happened.

**Partially meets expectations (3-5 pts):**
Mentions timing but doesn't fully explain why it matters. May note she started businesses "early" without connecting to brand value decay.

**Fully meets expectations (6-8 pts):**
Explains the sequencing logic: "Serena launched Serena Ventures (2014) and S by Serena (2018) while still competing, so her businesses had traction before her playing career ended. Brand value declines post-retirement, so starting early captures peak leverage."

---

**CRITERION 3: Application with Reasoning**

**Points:** 7

**Does not meet expectations (0-2 pts):**
No clear application, or lists multiple items without prioritizing. No reasoning provided.

**Partially meets expectations (3-4 pts):**
Identifies a strategic decision but reasoning is thin. May say "start investing early" without explaining why this beats other options.

**Fully meets expectations (5-7 pts):**
Clear prioritization with reasoning: "The ONE decision I'd prioritize: launch an owned business by age 28. Why? Endorsement income peaks during playing years but equity value grows independently. A 25-year-old has 10+ years of peak brand value to leverage—waiting until retirement wastes that window."

## Instructor Notes

**Module 6 Purpose:**
- Assess Week 4 learning through reflection on Serena Williams case
- Lighter assessment aligned with simplified Module 5 (video + widget)
- Clean handoff to Module 7 (CFL Expansion milestone)

**Assessment Flow (Simplified Modules 5-6):**
1. Module 5: Students watch video, explore Portfolio Analyzer (~15-20 min)
2. Module 6: Students write 300-word reflection on what they learned (25 pts)

**Why Lighter Assessment:**
- Module 5 provides focused learning through video and interactive widget
- Assessment should match the learning investment
- 300 words is enough to demonstrate strategic thinking
- Reflection format encourages synthesis over recitation

**For Students Who Want More Challenge:**
Students who explored multiple scenarios in the Portfolio Analyzer can provide more detailed analysis of the trade-offs. The rubric rewards specificity—students who can articulate specific numbers and timing will score higher.

**Grading Notes:**
- Look for equity vs. fees distinction (the core insight)
- The timing criterion is the key differentiator between surface and deep responses
- Accept any reasonable prioritization if well-defended
- Specific references to video and widget beat vague generalizations
