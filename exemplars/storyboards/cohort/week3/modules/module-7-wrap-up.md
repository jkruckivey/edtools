## Element 1: Week 3 Key Takeaways - Sponsorship & Betting

```
Title: ◉ Week 3 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into sponsorship and betting economics! The five critical insights: (1) sponsorship ROI is calculated using CPM, reach metrics, and the 1:2-3 activation rule—rights fees are just the start, (2) sports betting creates engagement multipliers where bettors watch 40% more games, driving premium partnership valuations, (3) ethical considerations like sportswashing require stakeholder impact analysis beyond financial metrics, (4) controversy-adjusted ROI helps quantify brand risk when sponsors have reputational concerns, and (5) professional sponsorship decisions balance quantitative frameworks with ethical judgment. This foundation prepares you for Week 4's focus on athlete brands and emerging sports—where individual athletes build wealth beyond endorsement fees. Well done!

**Up Next:** CFL Expansion Milestone 3, then Week 4 preview.

## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 3 - Sponsorship & Partnership Strategy

Your CFL expansion city needs sponsors—and more importantly, it needs a STADIUM. In Milestone 1, you analyzed market feasibility. In Milestone 2, you designed media and content strategy. Now you'll build the sponsorship portfolio for your chosen city, starting with the most critical partnership of all.

**CFL Reality Check:** The CFL has identified **BUILDING a stadium** as the #1 barrier to expansion. Any expansion city needs a CFL-ready facility. This creates your biggest sponsorship opportunity: a founding partner who helps fund the stadium bid and construction in exchange for naming rights and long-term partnership.

**Your Challenge:** Design a sponsorship strategy that starts with your anchor deal—the Stadium Development Partner—and builds out a complete sponsorship portfolio. Calculate expected revenue using CPM benchmarks and address ethical considerations.

**Why This Matters:** The stadium partner isn't just naming rights—it's the deal that makes expansion viable. Without a committed stadium partner, your city can't host CFL games.

**Apply Week 3 Frameworks:**
- Identify potential stadium development partners in your market
- Use CPM calculations to value your sponsorship assets
- Apply the 1:2-3 activation rule to project total partnership value
- Consider engagement multipliers if pursuing betting partnerships
