## Element 1: Bridge Video Scenario `[v1.4.0]`

**Video Title:** "The Athlete Brand Paradox"
**Caption File:** `Videos/HeyGen Scripts/VIDEO #12 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W4-M0, V1 (Bridge-In Hook)-caption.srt`
**Video Status:** ✅ Produced - Caption file available
**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Format:** Direct-to-camera AI presenter

**Video Content Summary (from caption):**
```
[0:00-0:18] The Paradox Setup
"Serena Williams' career generated nearly $95 million in prize money over 27 years. Her endorsement earnings over her career were substantial. Yet her total brand equity—including her ventures, media presence, and business ownership—represents significantly more value than either of those components alone."

[0:18-0:45] The Strategic Insight
"So where does that additional brand value come from? How do you BUILD a brand worth 5 times your on-field earnings? Here's what I've learned: Elite brand value isn't built on performance alone. Serena is one of the greatest athletes ever, but so are dozens of tennis players who never reached 10 percent of her brand equity. The difference is strategic brand architecture."

[0:46-1:03] Week Preview
"This week, you'll learn how elite athletes build substantial personal brands. You'll understand the five revenue streams athletes use—and which create long-term wealth versus short-term income. You'll explore why women's sports are attracting significant investment."

[1:04-1:12] Transition to Diagnostic
"But first: Can you already explain where that brand value comes from? Take the diagnostic exercise next. Reveal your gaps now—so we can fill them together."
```

### Video Script: "The $500 Million Question" (SME Direct-to-Camera)

**Recording Setup:** SME on camera, professional background, teleprompter optional

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in sports marketing and athlete representation—
most recently as [ROLE] at [ORGANIZATION]. I've negotiated endorsement deals worth hundreds of
millions of dollars for athletes across multiple sports.

And I want to start Week 4 with a problem that challenges everything most people think they
know about athlete brands."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $500 Million Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "Forbes estimates Serena Williams' net worth at around $350-500 million—depending on
valuation date—far exceeding her on-court earnings. Her career prize money totals nearly
$95 million over 27 years. Her endorsement earnings over her career exceed $350 million.

[VISUAL CUE: Show slide with numbers breakdown]

So where does all that additional value come from? And more importantly:
How do you BUILD a brand worth 5x your on-field earnings?

[Pause, lean forward]

Most people think athlete brands are simple: Win championships, get endorsements, make money.
But that's not how it actually works.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Brand Value ≠ Prize Money + Endorsements"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's what I've learned working with elite athletes: Elite brand value isn't built
on performance alone. Serena is one of the greatest athletes of all time—but so are dozens of
other tennis players who never reached even 10% of her net worth.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Performance ≠ Brand Value"]

The difference isn't just winning. It's strategic brand architecture. It's understanding:
• Which revenue streams to prioritize
• When to leverage your playing career vs. invest in post-career assets
• How to build equity in businesses you OWN, not just endorse
• Why women's sports present unique opportunities—and unique challenges

Serena didn't just win 23 Grand Slams. She built a portfolio of businesses, investment
vehicles, and owned assets that generate value independent of her playing career.


[1:50-2:30] LEARNING CHALLENGE & CALL-TO-ACTION

SME: "This week, you're going to learn how elite athletes build substantial personal brands. You'll
understand the five revenue streams athletes use—and which ones create long-term wealth versus
short-term income. You'll explore why women's sports are the fastest-growing investment
opportunity in sports business. And you'll analyze Serena Williams' strategic decisions to
understand exactly how she built generational wealth.

[Pause]

But first, I want to know: Do you ALREADY understand how athlete brands are built? Can you
explain where that additional value comes from?

Right now, before you learn anything this week, test yourself. Take the diagnostic exercise
that follows this video. Be honest. Reveal your knowledge gaps NOW—so we can fill them together.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Next: Diagnostic Exercise + Pre-Assessment"]

Let's find out what you already know... and what you're about to discover."

## Element 2: AI Roleplay Scenario - The Brand Value Question

**Scenario Title:** "The Brand Value Question: Can You Explain It Now?"

**Purpose:** Diagnostic activity that reveals knowledge gaps about athlete branding before content delivery. Students attempt to explain Serena Williams' net worth ~$350-500M using current understanding—most will struggle, creating motivation for Week 4 content.

**When to Use:** Immediately after the bridge video (Element 1)

**Assessment Type:** Diagnostic/Formative (not graded)

---

### Uplimit AI Roleplay Configuration

**Tab 1: Learning Outcome**

**Widget Name:** The Brand Value Question

**Learning Outcome:**
```
Students will demonstrate their current understanding of athlete brand building by attempting to explain a complex valuation problem (Serena Williams' net worth ~$350-500M) using their pre-existing knowledge. This diagnostic activity will reveal gaps in three key areas:

1. Athlete revenue streams knowledge (can they identify all 5 major sources beyond endorsements?)
2. Owned assets vs. endorsements (do they understand equity building vs. fee-based income?)
3. Strategic timing (can they articulate when to prioritize playing career vs. post-career investments?)

Success = Student finishes knowing exactly what they DON'T know yet, with motivation to learn Week 4 content.
```

**Scenario Setup:** Diagnostic (pre-learning assessment)

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

**Context:**
```
A junior analyst at a sports marketing agency has been asked by their supervisor to explain why Serena Williams' net worth far exceeds her career prize money (nearly $95 million over 27 years) and endorsement earnings ($350+ million). The learner will attempt to explain the brand architecture that creates substantial wealth beyond playing earnings, revealing their current understanding of athlete revenue streams, owned assets versus endorsements, and post-career wealth building. This diagnostic conversation helps identify knowledge gaps before Week 4 content delivery.
```

**Role of AI (Supervisor):**
```
A senior executive at a sports marketing agency who asks probing questions to help the junior analyst discover gaps in their understanding of athlete brand valuation.
```

**Role of Student:**
```
The learner plays the role of a junior analyst attempting to explain Serena Williams' substantial brand valuation to their supervisor using pre-existing knowledge.
```

---

**Tab 3: Hidden Context**

```
**AI Character Context:**
You are a senior sports marketing executive conducting a diagnostic conversation. The student is encountering athlete brand strategy for the first time. Most will struggle—this is intentional and pedagogically valuable.

**What Students Typically Miss (use to guide probing):**
- Owned businesses vs. endorsement fees (Serena Ventures investment fund, S by Serena clothing line, own the equity)
- Media/content production (producing content creates IP value, not just appearance fees)
- Licensing/IP (name and likeness rights, trademark value)
- Post-career transition planning (building assets during playing career that mature after retirement)
- Women's sports investment thesis (first-mover advantage in undervalued market)

**AI Personality Traits:**
- Patient but probing: You know they're learning, so you don't expect perfection—but you want to understand their thinking
- Business-focused: You care about clear explanations backed by strategic reasoning, not jargon
- Socratic: When they struggle, you ask questions that help them discover gaps rather than lecturing
- Realistic: You acknowledge that athlete branding is complex with multiple revenue streams

**Conversation Strategy:**

Wait for the student to start the conversation. They've been asked to explain where Serena's $150-200M additional brand value comes from. Listen to their opening explanation, then respond with probing questions based on what they say:

1. If they mention only endorsements/sponsorships, ask: "What other ways do elite athletes generate revenue and build wealth?"

2. If they struggle to identify streams, ask: "Think about assets Serena OWNS versus fees she EARNS. What's the difference in terms of long-term value?"

3. If they list streams but don't distinguish owned vs. endorsed, ask: "If she endorses Nike, does she own equity in Nike? What if she started her own clothing line instead?"

4. Closing (after 3-4 exchanges): Acknowledge their effort and gaps: "You've identified some pieces, but I can tell you're missing the distinction between fee-based income and equity-based wealth building—that's the key to understanding athlete brands. This week's content will give you the framework to answer this question confidently."

Exit gracefully after 3-4 exchanges even if they're still struggling—the goal is diagnosis, not mastery.

**Conversation Objectives (3-4 exchanges):**
1. **Opening:** Let student explain their initial thinking without interruption
2. **Probe #1:** If they mention only endorsements, ask about other revenue streams
3. **Probe #2:** If they don't distinguish owned assets from endorsements, ask about equity vs. fees
4. **Closing:** Acknowledge effort, name specific gaps (e.g., "You identified endorsements but missed owned businesses and equity investments"), and encourage them that Week 4 will fill these gaps

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Student attempts answer (even if incomplete)
- ✅ Student recognizes their knowledge gaps
- ✅ Student feels motivated to learn, not defeated

**After 3-4 exchanges:** Provide rubric-aligned feedback using the 3 criteria defined in the Criteria tab.
```

**Tab 4: Criteria**

**CRITERION 1: Revenue Streams Knowledge**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner identifies multiple athlete revenue sources beyond endorsements.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner mentions only endorsements or provides minimal identification of revenue streams without demonstrating understanding of the five major sources (owned businesses, investments, media/content, licensing).

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner identifies 2-3 revenue streams beyond endorsements but may miss key streams (investments, media/content, licensing) or provide limited explanation of how streams differ from endorsements.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner identifies 4-5 revenue streams beyond endorsements (owned businesses, investments, media/content production, licensing, speaking engagements) and demonstrates understanding that these represent diverse wealth-building approaches beyond fee-based endorsements.

---

**CRITERION 2: Owned Assets vs. Endorsements**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner distinguishes between fee-based income (endorsements) and equity-based wealth (owned businesses, investments).

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner does not recognize the distinction between endorsement fees and owned asset equity, treating all revenue streams as equivalent or focusing only on income generation.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner demonstrates basic awareness that owned assets differ from endorsements but provides limited explanation of equity building versus fee-based income or misses long-term wealth implications.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner clearly articulates the distinction between fee-based endorsement income (temporary, tied to playing career) and equity-based wealth (ownership in businesses and investments that compound over time), explaining why owned assets create generational wealth.

---

**CRITERION 3: Strategic Timing**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner articulates that athletes must build post-career assets during playing career when brand value is highest.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner does not mention timing considerations or suggests post-career planning happens after retirement, missing the critical insight that assets must be built during peak brand value years.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner mentions that timing matters but provides limited explanation of why building assets during playing career is critical or misses the brand value decline post-retirement (60-80%).

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner clearly explains that elite athletes must build owned businesses and investments during their playing career (ages 25-35) when brand value is highest, because brand value declines 60-80% post-retirement and endorsement opportunities fade, making assets built during career essential for sustaining wealth.

Which of the following is NOT typically considered one of the five major athlete revenue streams?
```

**Options:**

```
Salary from team contracts ✅
```

```
Endorsement deals with brands
```

```
Owned businesses and equity stakes
```

```
Media and content production
```

**After Submission:**
```
The five major athlete revenue streams are: endorsements, owned businesses, investments, media/content production, and licensing. Team salary is employment income, not a brand-building revenue stream.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Team salary is employment compensation, separate from brand monetization. The five streams that build athlete brands are: endorsements, owned businesses, investments, media/content, and licensing.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Endorsements, owned businesses, and media production are all athlete brand revenue streams. Team salary is different—it's employment income, not brand monetization.

Which athlete revenue stream has shown the HIGHEST growth potential over the past decade?
```

**Options:**

```
Traditional endorsement deals

```
Appearance fees and speaking engagements
```

```
Licensing and merchandise royalties
```

```
Owned businesses and venture investments ✅
```

**After Submission:**
```
Athletes who own equity in businesses—rather than just endorsing them—capture exponentially more value. LeBron's stake in Blaze Pizza and Serena's venture fund exemplify this shift.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Athletes like LeBron ($300M from Blaze Pizza stake) and Serena (Serena Ventures portfolio) have generated more wealth from owned businesses than from endorsement fees.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
While endorsements and licensing provide steady income, owned businesses and investments create equity that compounds over time—the highest-growth opportunity for athletes.

### Challenge 2: Compare Owned vs. Endorsed

**The Problem:** An athlete asks: "Should I sign this $5M endorsement deal, or invest $2M to launch my own brand?" Can you explain the trade-offs between fee-based income and equity ownership?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Why endorsement fees are "renting" your brand vs. "owning" value
- How equity compounds over time while fees stay flat
- When each strategy makes sense (career stage, risk tolerance)

**Test yourself:** Can you explain why Michael Jordan's Nike deal structure made him a billionaire while other athletes with similar endorsement fees aren't?

2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
What is the PRIMARY advantage of owned businesses over endorsement deals for athletes?
```

**Options:**

```
Owned businesses require less time commitment
```

```
Endorsement deals have more brand risk
```

```
Equity ownership compounds value; endorsement fees stay flat ✅
```

```
Owned businesses are easier to exit
```

**After Submission:**
```
Endorsement fees are "renting" your brand—you get paid, then it's over. Equity ownership means the value you help create compounds over time and belongs to you.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! A $5M/year endorsement = $50M over 10 years. But $2M invested in a business you help grow to $100M = $20M+ in equity. Ownership compounds; fees don't.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Time commitment and exit strategies vary. The key difference is value capture: endorsement fees end when contracts end, but equity ownership builds wealth that compounds.

LeBron James earned approximately $300M from his stake in Blaze Pizza. What made this different from a typical endorsement deal?
```

**Options:**

```
Blaze Pizza paid him more per year than other sponsors
```

```
He took equity instead of (or in addition to) endorsement fees ✅
```

```
The pizza industry has higher profit margins than sportswear
```

```
He appeared in more Blaze Pizza commercials than other brands
```

**After Submission:**
```
LeBron's Blaze Pizza strategy exemplifies the shift from "endorser" to "owner." By taking equity, he captured value from the company's growth rather than just collecting fees.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Perfect! LeBron invested early and took equity. When Blaze grew from 50 to 300+ locations, his stake multiplied in value—something endorsement fees can never do.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
The difference wasn't payment amount or ad frequency—it was ownership structure. LeBron owned equity in Blaze, so when the company grew, his stake grew with it.

```
Women's sports have always been equally valued
```

```
Historically undervalued assets are being repriced as viewership and sponsorship grow ✅
```

**After Submission:**
```
Women's sports represent a market correction: assets that were systematically undervalued are being repriced as viewership, sponsorship, and media rights demonstrate their true market value.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Women's sports were underinvested for decades. Now, growing viewership (WNBA up 16%), new media deals, and sponsor demand are revealing the true market value.

Tax benefits specific to women's sports ownership
```

```
Required by their existing sponsorship contracts

```
Women's teams are cheaper to operate than men's teams
```

**After Submission:**
```
Smart investors recognize that women's sports represent asymmetric opportunity: relatively low entry costs with high growth potential as the market matures.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! WNBA teams purchased for $10-20M a few years ago are now valued at $100M+. Athletes with visibility and capital are positioning themselves in an emerging market.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Tax benefits and operating costs aren't the drivers. Athletes are investing because they see an undervalued market with significant growth potential—classic first-mover opportunity.

**What you'll need to know:**
- Why timing matters (brand value peaks during playing career)

When is an athlete's brand value typically at its PEAK?
```

**Options:**

```
Immediately after retirement when nostalgia peaks

```
5-10 years after retirement when legacy is established
```

```
During their prime playing years (typically ages 25-35) ✅
```

```
Brand value stays constant throughout their lifetime
```

**After Submission:**
```
Brand value is highest when athletes are actively competing, visible, and generating headlines. This window is the critical time to convert attention into owned assets.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Athletes have maximum leverage during their playing prime. Media attention, sponsor interest, and deal flow all peak when they're winning—the time to build assets.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Nostalgia and legacy matter, but brand value peaks during active competition. Post-retirement, attention and opportunities decline significantly—often 60-80%.

Brand value usually increases after retirement
```

**After Submission:**
```
The harsh reality: most athletes see dramatic brand value decline post-retirement. Only those who built owned assets and businesses during their career maintain long-term wealth.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Studies show endorsement value drops 60-80% within 2-3 years of retirement. This is why building owned assets DURING the playing career is critical.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Brand value doesn't increase or stay flat. Most athletes experience 60-80% decline in endorsement value within 2-3 years of retirement—making career-stage planning essential.

## Element 4N: AI Chat Widget - Results Discussion Coach `[v3.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **AI Chat Widget** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Widget Name:** Pre-Assessment Results Coach

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a supportive learning coach helping MBA students interpret their pre-assessment results for Week 4 of a sports business course. Students just completed an 8-question diagnostic quiz covering four learning outcomes:

**WLO 4.1 - Athlete Revenue Streams:** Five streams (endorsements, owned businesses, investments, media/content, licensing), which build equity vs. generate fees
**WLO 4.2 - Owned vs. Endorsed:** Equity compounds while fees stay flat, LeBron's Blaze Pizza model, when to prioritize ownership
**WLO 4.3 - Women's Sports Investment:** Undervalued market thesis, growth metrics, first-mover advantage
**WLO 4.4 - Post-Career Transition:** Brand value peaks during playing years, 60-80% post-retirement decline, building assets early

**Your role:**
1. Ask students how many questions they answered correctly (0-8)
2. Provide personalized guidance based on their score:
   - **0-2/8:** "You're starting fresh—perfect! This week's content will build strong foundations. Focus on Module 3's athlete revenue framework and the Athlete Brand Calculator."
   - **3-4/8:** "Solid baseline—you have some pieces of the puzzle. This week will help you connect revenue streams to wealth-building strategy. Pay attention to the owned vs. endorsed comparison."
   - **5-6/8:** "Strong foundation! You're ready to dive deep into applications. Challenge yourself with the Serena Williams case analysis and Emerging Sports Investment Tool."
   - **7-8/8:** "Excellent! You already understand core concepts. Focus on nuanced applications—timing of asset building, women's sports investment thesis, post-career transition planning."
3. If they ask about specific questions, provide brief clarifications using the WLO concepts above
4. Encourage them that pre-assessments reveal learning opportunities, not deficiencies
5. Direct them to Module 1 (Executive Perspectives) after discussion

**Tone:** Supportive, encouraging, concrete (use specific examples), MBA-level (business-focused not academic)

**Do NOT:**
- Provide quiz answers directly (if they ask, say "The quiz helps you self-diagnose, but I can discuss concepts")
- Overwhelm them with too much content (keep responses 2-3 sentences)
- Make them feel bad about low scores (frame as opportunities)
```

**Welcome Message:**
```
Hi! I'm here to help you interpret your pre-assessment results and plan your learning path for Week 4. How many questions did you answer correctly out of 8? Or if you have questions about specific concepts from the quiz, I'm happy to discuss them!
```

**Show System Prompt to User:** No

Title: 💡 What Your Pre-Assessment Results Mean

Your quiz results create a personalized learning path for this week. Lower scores (0-3/8) suggest spending extra time with Module 3's core content on athlete revenue streams and the Athlete Brand Calculator exercise—you're building fresh foundations. Higher scores (5-8/8) indicate solid baseline knowledge, so challenge yourself with the Serena Williams case analysis and the Emerging Sports Investment Tool. Remember: this quiz isn't graded, it's a diagnostic tool to help you learn efficiently. Now that you know where you stand, let's build those athlete brand strategies.
