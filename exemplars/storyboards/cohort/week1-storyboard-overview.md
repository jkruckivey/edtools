## NEW Simplified Widget Set (January 2026)

The following **simplified explorers** replace the complex simulators for better testability and Uplimit MCQ integration:

| New Widget | Replaces | Format |
|------------|----------|--------|
| `revenue-streams-explorer.html` | `revenue-mix-slider.html` | Visual + 2 MCQs |
| `dynamic-pricing-explorer.html` | `dynamic-pricing-simulator.html` | Pre-check + Sliders + 3 MCQs |
| `betting-basics-explorer.html` | `betting-market-simulator.html` | Revenue models + 3 MCQs |
| `ecosystem-roleplay.html` | `ecosystem-cascade-simulator.html` | Branching (8 endings) + 3 MCQs |
| `nashville-case-quiz.html` | NEW | Case comprehension 5 MCQs |

**Design Philosophy:**
1. **Pre-check** → Assess prior knowledge
2. **Explore** → Interactive visual discovery
3. **Verify** → MCQs confirm understanding
4. **Discuss** → AI Coach prompts for deeper exploration

**Storyboard Integration Notes:**
- Replace complex simulator iFrames with new explorer widgets
- Move challenges/graded activities to Uplimit's native MCQ system
- Use AI Chat widget coach for post-exploration discussions
- Legacy widgets remain available for instructor reference
