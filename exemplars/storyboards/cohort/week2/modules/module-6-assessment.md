## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
## What Did You Learn?

You've explored the Rogers NHL deal through data tables showing what went wrong, and you advised the CEO on the 2026 decision through the AI advisor.

Now capture what you learned. This isn't about getting the "right answer"—it's about showing you understand media rights economics and can apply that thinking to real decisions.
```

## Element 2: Infobox - Assessment Overview

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element
2. Choose variant: **Assessment** (purple)
3. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
Title: ▪ Assessment: Media Rights Reflection (25 points)

**Your Task:** In 300 words or less, reflect on what you learned about media rights economics from the Rogers NHL case.

**Your reflection should address:**

1. **The Big Mistake** - What was Rogers' single biggest miscalculation, and why did it matter?
2. **The Framework** - How does the "projections vs. actuals" comparison illustrate media rights risk?
3. **Your 2026 Call** - What did you recommend to the AI advisor, and what trade-off did you accept?

**Grading (25 points):**
- Mistake analysis with reasoning (10 pts)
- Framework understanding (8 pts)
- Decision trade-off awareness (7 pts)

**Tip:** Be specific. "They paid too much" is vague. "They projected 3-5% viewership growth but got -40% due to cord-cutting" shows framework thinking.
```

## Element 3: Text Response - Media Rights Reflection

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise → Text Response Question**
2. Configure the following fields:

**Question:**
```
What did you learn about media rights economics from the Rogers NHL case? Reflect in 300 words or less.
```

**Additional Instructions:**
```
Your response will be evaluated on:

**Mistake Analysis (10 pts)**
- Identifies Rogers' biggest miscalculation
- Explains WHY it was a mistake (not just WHAT happened)
- Uses specific data (e.g., "viewership down 40%", "cable subs down 35%")

**Framework Understanding (8 pts)**
- Shows understanding of media rights valuation risk
- References the projections vs. actuals gap
- Demonstrates "ecosystem thinking" about cord-cutting, streaming, etc.

**Decision Trade-off (7 pts)**
- States the 2026 recommendation clearly (renew, renegotiate, or walk)
- Acknowledges the trade-off or risk in that choice
- Shows strategic reasoning, not just opinion

**Reference the Module 5 content:**
- The deal terms table
- The projections vs. actuals comparison
- Your 2026 Decision Advisor conversation
```

**AI Feedback Prompt:**
```
Evaluate this media rights reflection. Check for:
1. Did they identify a specific mistake with reasoning (not just "paid too much")?
2. Did they reference data from the tables (viewership, subscriber, revenue numbers)?
3. Did they acknowledge a trade-off in their 2026 recommendation?

Provide brief, encouraging feedback. If their analysis is vague, ask for specific numbers.
```

**Rubric Configuration:**

---

**CRITERION 1: Mistake Analysis**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Mistake is vague or generic (e.g., "paid too much"). No explanation of WHY it was a mistake. No data cited.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Identifies a mistake but explanation is surface-level. May cite some data but doesn't connect it to the reasoning.

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Clearly identifies a specific miscalculation (e.g., "projected viewership growth, got decline"). Explains the underlying misjudgment (cord-cutting, streaming cannibalization). Cites specific numbers from the case tables.

---

**CRITERION 2: Framework Understanding**

**Points:** 8

**Does not meet expectations (0-2 pts):**
No evidence of framework thinking. Just describes what happened without analyzing why.

**Partially meets expectations (3-5 pts):**
Shows some framework understanding but doesn't fully apply it. May mention projections vs. actuals without explaining the significance.

**Fully meets expectations (6-8 pts):**
Demonstrates understanding of media rights valuation risk. Connects cord-cutting, streaming shifts, and viewership decline into coherent analysis. Shows how projections vs. actuals reveals systematic overconfidence.

---

**CRITERION 3: Decision Trade-off**

**Points:** 7

**Does not meet expectations (0-2 pts):**
No clear 2026 recommendation, or recommendation without reasoning. No trade-off acknowledged.

**Partially meets expectations (3-4 pts):**
States a recommendation but trade-off analysis is weak or missing. May say "I'd renegotiate" without explaining what they're giving up.

**Fully meets expectations (5-7 pts):**
Clear recommendation with reasoning. Explicitly acknowledges what they're sacrificing (e.g., "Walking away means losing Sportsnet's anchor, but avoids another $2B loss"). Shows strategic maturity.

## Instructor Notes

**Module 6 Purpose:**
- Assess Week 2 learning through reflection on Rogers case exploration
- Lighter assessment aligned with simplified Module 5 (text tables + AI chat)
- Clean handoff to Module 7 (CFL Expansion milestone)

**Assessment Flow (Simplified Modules 5-6):**
1. Module 5: Students explore Rogers deal through tables and AI decision advisor (~15 min)
2. Module 6: Students write 300-word reflection on what they learned (25 pts)

**Why Lighter Assessment:**
- Simplified Module 5 is ~15 minutes of exploration, not 90+ minutes of case analysis
- Assessment should match the learning investment
- 300 words is enough to demonstrate framework understanding
- Reflection format encourages insight over recitation

**For Students Who Want More Challenge:**
Students who engaged deeply with the 2026 Decision Advisor can reference their conversation in detail. The rubric rewards specificity—students who can explain their trade-off reasoning with specific numbers will score higher.

**Grading Notes:**
- Look for framework thinking (why projections failed), not just describing what happened
- The trade-off acknowledgment is the key differentiator between surface and deep responses
- Accept any of the three 2026 options if well-defended—no "right answer"
- Specific numbers from the tables beat vague generalizations
