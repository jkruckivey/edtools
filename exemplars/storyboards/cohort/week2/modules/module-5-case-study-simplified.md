## The Deal Structure: $5.2B Over 12 Years

Rogers' 2013 NHL deal was unprecedented in Canadian sports media. Here's what $433M/year bought:

### Rights Included

| Rights Package | What It Covers | Strategic Value |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **National TV (English)** | All national broadcasts on Sportsnet | Core asset—replaced TSN as NHL home |
| **Hockey Night in Canada** | Iconic Saturday night franchise | Brand value + guaranteed audience |
| **Playoffs & Stanley Cup** | All playoff games, Finals | Premium advertising inventory |
| **Digital & Streaming** | Online, mobile, OTT rights | Future-proofing (or so they thought) |
| **Out-of-market games** | NHL GameCentre Live | Subscription revenue opportunity |

### Payment Structure

| Years | Annual Payment | Total |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Years 1-4 (2014-2018) | $400M | $1.6B |
| Years 5-8 (2018-2022) | $440M | $1.76B |
| Years 9-12 (2022-2026) | $460M | $1.84B |
| **Total** | **$433M avg/year** | **$5.2B** |

### Key Terms

- **Exclusivity:** Rogers controls ALL English-language national NHL rights
- **Sublicensing:** Can sell some games to other networks (they sold some back to TSN)
- **No escape clause:** Locked in for 12 years regardless of viewership

**The Bet:** Rogers assumed hockey viewership would grow 3-5% annually and streaming would complement, not cannibalize, TV. They were wrong on both counts.

## What Rogers Projected vs. What Actually Happened

The $5.2B deal was built on optimistic assumptions. Here's how reality compared:

### Advertising Revenue

| Year | Rogers Projected | Actual | Gap |
|------|------------------|--------|-----|
| 2014-15 | $250M | $230M | -8% |
| 2016-17 | $300M | $245M | -18% |
| 2018-19 | $350M | $260M | -26% |
| 2020-21 | $400M | $180M* | -55% |
| 2022-23 | $450M | $275M | -39% |

*COVID-shortened season

### Subscriber Revenue (Cable/Streaming)

| Metric | 2013 Projection | 2023 Actual |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Cable subscribers | Stable | -35% (cord-cutting) |
| Streaming subscribers | +500K by 2020 | +200K (slower uptake) |
| Average revenue per user | $85/month | $62/month |

### What Went Wrong?

1. **Cord-cutting accelerated faster than expected** - Lost 2M+ cable subs
2. **Canadian dollar dropped** - NHL salary costs (in USD) rose, squeezing team budgets
3. **No Canadian team in Stanley Cup Finals** - Ratings depend heavily on Canadian teams winning
4. **Streaming cannibalized cable** - People shifted but paid less
5. **COVID wiped out 2020** - No games = no ad revenue, but still owed NHL payments

**The Result:** Estimated $1-2B loss on the deal, though Rogers has never confirmed exact figures.

## How NHL Viewership Changed (2013-2025)

The media landscape transformed dramatically during Rogers' deal:

### Canadian Viewership Trends

| Season | Avg Regular Season (millions) | Playoffs (millions) | Notes |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| 2013-14 | 1.2M | 3.1M | Pre-Rogers baseline |
| 2015-16 | 1.0M | 2.8M | First full Rogers season |
| 2017-18 | 0.95M | 2.5M | Cord-cutting begins |
| 2019-20 | 0.85M | 1.8M* | COVID bubble playoffs |
| 2021-22 | 0.78M | 2.3M | Recovery, but lower base |
| 2023-24 | 0.72M | 2.4M | Streaming fragments audience |

### The Platform Shift

| Platform | 2013 Share | 2023 Share |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Cable TV | 85% | 48% |
| Streaming (SN Now) | 5% | 32% |
| Other digital | 10% | 20% |

### Key Insights

**What this means:**
- Total viewership DOWN 40% from 2013 baseline
- But it's not that people stopped watching—they watch **differently**
- Streaming viewers pay LESS than cable subscribers
- Live sports is one of few things keeping cable alive at all

**The Paradox:** NHL ratings are actually UP in the US (ESPN+ deal working), but DOWN in Canada where Rogers has exclusivity. More competition in the US may have helped the league.

```
It's January 2026. Rogers' NHL rights deal expires after this season. The board has called an emergency strategy session to decide: renew, renegotiate, or walk away?

You've been hired as an external media strategy consultant. The CEO wants your recommendation—but he'll challenge your thinking before committing billions more dollars.

The situation:
- Rogers paid $5.2B for 2014-2026 NHL rights
- Estimated losses: $1-2B over the deal
- Bell/TSN will aggressively bid if Rogers walks away
- Decision must be made within 60 days

WHAT WENT WRONG (5 key factors):
1. Cord-cutting accelerated faster than expected - Lost 2M+ cable subs
2. Canadian dollar dropped - NHL salary costs (in USD) rose, squeezing team budgets
3. No Canadian team in Stanley Cup Finals since 2011 - Ratings depend heavily on Canadian teams winning
4. Streaming cannibalized cable - People shifted but paid less
5. COVID wiped out 2020 - No games = no ad revenue, but still owed NHL payments

VIEWERSHIP TRENDS (Canadian market):
| Season | Avg Regular Season | Playoffs | Notes |
| 2013-14 | 1.2M | 3.1M | Pre-Rogers baseline |
| 2015-16 | 1.0M | 2.8M | First full Rogers season |
| 2017-18 | 0.95M | 2.5M | Cord-cutting begins |
| 2019-20 | 0.85M | 1.8M | COVID bubble playoffs |
| 2021-22 | 0.78M | 2.3M | Recovery, but lower base |
| 2023-24 | 0.72M | 2.4M | Streaming fragments audience |

PLATFORM SHIFT:
| Platform | 2013 Share | 2023 Share |
| Cable TV | 85% | 48% |
| Streaming (SN Now) | 5% | 32% |
| Other digital | 10% | 20% |

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Total viewership DOWN 40% from 2013 baseline
- Viewers watch differently, not less—but streaming pays less than cable
- Live sports is one of few things keeping cable alive
- NHL ratings UP in US (ESPN+ deal working), DOWN in Canada (Rogers exclusivity)
- Estimated total losses: $1-2 billion over 12-year deal

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (2026):
- Bell/TSN: Would aggressively bid; NHL rights would restore TSN to dominance
- Amazon/Apple: Exploring Canadian sports streaming; could disrupt traditional model
- NHL: Knows Rogers is desperate; has leverage in negotiations
- Sportsnet without hockey: Loses ~30% of cable subscriber value proposition

ARGUMENTS FOR EACH OPTION:

RENEW:
- Losing hockey to Bell would devastate Sportsnet's value proposition
- Live sports is only content keeping cable subscribers from cutting cord
- Hockey is cultural anchor for Rogers brand in Canada
- Could negotiate better terms (shorter deal, revenue sharing, streaming carve-outs)
- Bell inheriting hockey doesn't help Rogers—it accelerates Sportsnet decline

RENEGOTIATE:
- NHL needs Canadian broadcaster; can't ignore market
- Shorter deal (4-5 years) reduces long-term risk
- Revenue sharing model transfers some risk to NHL
- Streaming-only rights could reduce costs significantly
- Leverage: "We'll walk away and you'll get less from Bell"

WALK AWAY:
- Already lost $1-2B—why throw more money at a failing model?
- Streaming economics don't support $400M+/year rights fees
- Bell inherits the problem, not Rogers
- Could invest $400M/year in original content, other sports, or tech
- Sportsnet survives with regional rights, Blue Jays, other content

=== CONVERSATION FLOW (AI should follow this) ===

1. OPENING: "You're here to advise me on the biggest decision I'll make this year. The NHL deal expires in 6 months. What's your recommendation—renew, renegotiate, or walk away?"

2. CHALLENGE THEIR ANSWER:
   - If RENEW: "We've lost $1-2 billion on this deal. Viewership is down 40%. What makes you think the next 12 years will be different? Show me the math."
   - If WALK AWAY: "If Bell takes hockey, Sportsnet loses its anchor. Our cable subscribers already dropped 35%—how do we stop the bleeding without live hockey?"
   - If RENEGOTIATE: "The NHL knows we're desperate. Bettman isn't stupid. What leverage do we actually have? They could just wait for Bell's check."

3. PROBE FOR SPECIFICS: "Let's get concrete. What's the MAXIMUM you'd recommend we pay per year? And for how many years? I need numbers for the board."

4. RAISE A CONCERN: Based on their answer, raise one realistic concern:
   - For renewal: "What if viewership drops another 20%? We'd be locked in again."
   - For walking away: "Our stock price is tied to Sportsnet. Analysts will panic."
   - For renegotiation: "What if the NHL says no and goes to Bell? Then we've lost everything."

5. WRAP UP (after 4-5 exchanges): "Alright, I think I understand your position. You're recommending [their choice] with [key terms]. The trade-off we're accepting is [main risk]. I'll take this to the board. Thanks for the straight talk."

=== TONE & BEHAVIOR ===
- Skeptical but fair—genuinely want good advice
- Push back on every recommendation (no easy answers)
- Ask for specific numbers, not vague generalizations
- Acknowledge good arguments when you hear them
- Show stress about the decision (billions of dollars, your legacy)
- Use data from the tables above to test their knowledge
- Keep exchanges focused (4-5 turns max, then wrap up)

=== WHAT TO AVOID ===
- Lecturing about media economics (you're the CEO, you know this)
- Telling them the "right" answer (there isn't one)
- Going beyond 5-6 exchanges (wrap up decisively)
- Being dismissive or hostile (you hired them for a reason)
- Accepting vague answers without pushing for specifics

## Element 6: Full Case Background (Optional)

2. Title: "Want the full story? Read the case background"

```markdown
[Condensed 1,500-word version of Rogers case]

### Background: Rogers in 2013

Rogers Communications was Canada's largest wireless carrier but faced a strategic challenge: its media division (Sportsnet) was losing ground to Bell's TSN. Bell had acquired the Montreal Canadiens and had strong regional sports rights.

### The Bidding War

When NHL rights came up for renewal in 2013, Rogers made an audacious play: $5.2 billion for 12 years, roughly 3x what the previous deal cost. Bell couldn't match it.

### The Strategy

Rogers believed:
1. Hockey would grow viewership 3-5% annually
2. Cable would remain dominant for live sports
3. Owning ALL national rights would give them monopoly pricing power
4. Digital streaming would be additive, not substitutional

### What Went Wrong

1. **Cord-cutting accelerated** - 2M+ cable subscribers gone
2. **Canadian dollar dropped** - Made US-denominated costs higher
3. **No Canadian teams winning** - Ratings depend on Canadian success
4. **Streaming grew but revenue didn't** - Lower ARPU than cable
5. **COVID hit** - 2020 season decimated, but payments continued

### The 2026 Decision

Rogers must now decide whether to renew, renegotiate, or walk away. Each option carries significant risk.
