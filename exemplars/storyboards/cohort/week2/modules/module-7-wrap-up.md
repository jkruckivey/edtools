## Element 1: Infobox Content

```
Title: ◉ Week 2 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into media rights and fan engagement! The five critical insights: (1) media rights are valued using CPM, reach, and exclusivity metrics—not just audience size, (2) streaming disruption creates both threats (cord-cutting) and opportunities (global reach, direct-to-consumer), (3) long-term rights deals carry significant risk when technology and consumption patterns shift mid-contract, (4) fan engagement monetization requires balancing reach (free content) against revenue (paywalls), and (5) platform strategy matters as much as content quality. This foundation prepares you for Week 3's focus on sponsorship activation and sports betting partnerships—revenue streams that amplify media value. Well done!

**Up Next:** CFL Expansion Milestone 2, then Week 3 preview.

## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 2 - Media & Content Strategy

Building on your market selection from Milestone 1, you'll now develop a media and content strategy for your CFL expansion franchise.

**Your Challenge:** How will your new CFL franchise maximize value within the league's media structure? What local audio partnerships can you secure? What's your content strategy for building fans before the first game?

**Important CFL Context:** Unlike some leagues, CFL media rights are negotiated at the **league level only**—the CFL-TSN deal covers all teams. Your expansion franchise will receive a share of league media revenue, but you won't negotiate your own TV or streaming deals. What you DO control: **Local Radio** and **Local Audio** rights.

**Why This Matters:** Your media strategy isn't about negotiating broadcast deals—it's about (1) understanding what revenue share you'll receive, (2) maximizing your local radio/audio presence, and (3) creating content that builds your fanbase and adds value to the league-wide package.

**Apply Week 2 Frameworks:**
- Understand league-level media economics and revenue sharing
- Design local radio/audio partnerships for your market
- Design fan engagement tactics that move passive viewers to super-fans
- Reference the Rogers/NHL case lessons for understanding long-term deal structures
